Cortical hyperexcitability is a hallmark of fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the Fmr1
knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS, cortical hyperexcitability is linked to sensory
hypersensitivity and seizure susceptibility. It remains unclear why homeostatic
mechanisms fail to prevent such activity. Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP) 
adjusts membrane excitability through regulation of ion channels to maintain
activity levels following activity perturbation. Despite the critical role of HIP
in the maturation of excitability, it has not been examined in FXS. Here, we
demonstrate that HIP does not operate normally in a disease model, FXS. HIP was
either lost or exaggerated in two distinct neuronal populations from Fmr1 KO
cortical cultures. In addition, we have identified a mechanism for homeostatic
intrinsic plasticity. Compromising HIP function during development could leave
cortical neurons in the FXS nervous system vulnerable to hyperexcitability.

The FMR1 premutation is an expansion of the CGG repeat island in the FMR1 gene to
between 55 and 200 repeats. Evidence suggests that as well as conferring risk for
neurodegeneration, the premutation is also associated with increased risk for
autistic traits and psychiatric symptoms. An emotional processing fMRI task was
used to examine the response to a change in emotional arousal in 17 male carriers
and 17 matched controls. A psychiatric symptom checklist (SCL-90-R), autism
spectrum and empathy quotients (AQ and EQ), and the Ekman Faces Test were used to
investigate clinical symptoms and emotional processing. Carriers exhibited
significantly lower activation compared to controls at the bilateral superior
parietal lobe, bilateral Brodmann Area (BA) 17 (V1), right intraparietal area and
right BA18 (V2) when comparing high and low arousal conditions. Group by age
analyses were not significant. Assessments revealed that carriers displayed
significantly worse symptoms of psychiatric symptoms and higher levels of
autistic traits, as well as impaired facial emotion recognition. No measurements 
revealed an association with age. Here, we show significantly altered emotional
processing in carriers which display stability over age, suggesting that, unlike 
degenerative aspects, emotional symptoms may be consistent over the lifespan in
carriers.

OBJECTIVES: The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is a widely expressed
RNA-binding protein involved in translation regulation. Since the absence of FMRP
leads to Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism, FMRP has been extensively studied
in brain. The functions of FMRP in peripheral organs and on metabolic homeostasis
remain elusive; therefore, we sought to investigate the systemic consequences of 
its absence.
METHODS: Using metabolomics, in vivo metabolic phenotyping of the Fmr1-KO FXS
mouse model and in vitro approaches, we show that the absence of FMRP induced a
metabolic shift towards enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity,
reduced adiposity, and increased β-adrenergic-driven lipolysis and lipid
utilization.
RESULTS: Combining proteomics and cellular assays, we highlight that FMRP loss
increased hepatic protein synthesis and impacted pathways notably linked to lipid
metabolism. Mapping metabolomic and proteomic phenotypes onto a signaling and
metabolic network, we predicted that the coordinated metabolic response to FMRP
loss was mediated by dysregulation in the abundances of specific hepatic
proteins. We experimentally validated these predictions, demonstrating that the
translational regulator FMRP associates with a subset of mRNAs involved in lipid 
metabolism. Finally, we highlight that FXS patients mirror metabolic variations
observed in Fmr1-KO mice with reduced circulating glucose and insulin and
increased free fatty acids.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of FMRP results in a widespread coordinated systemic response
that notably involves upregulation of protein translation in the liver, increased
utilization of lipids, and significant changes in metabolic homeostasis. Our
study unravels metabolic phenotypes in FXS and further supports the importance of
translational regulation in the homeostatic control of systemic metabolism.

Distinct genetic forms of autism are hypothesized to share a common increase in
excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratio in cerebral cortex, causing hyperexcitability
and excess spiking. We provide a systematic test of this hypothesis across 4
mouse models (Fmr1-/y, Cntnap2-/-, 16p11.2del/+, Tsc2+/-), focusing on
somatosensory cortex. All autism mutants showed reduced feedforward inhibition in
layer 2/3 coupled with more modest, variable reduction in feedforward excitation,
driving a common increase in E-I conductance ratio. Despite this, feedforward
spiking, synaptic depolarization, and spontaneous spiking were largely normal.
Modeling revealed that E and I conductance changes in each mutant were
quantitatively matched to yield stable, not increased, synaptic depolarization
for cells near spike threshold. Correspondingly, whisker-evoked spiking was not
increased in vivo despite detectably reduced inhibition. Thus, elevated E-I ratio
is a common circuit phenotype but appears to reflect homeostatic stabilization of
synaptic drive rather than driving network hyperexcitability in autism.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with premutation alleles of the fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are at risk of developing fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) during aging. Characterization of motor issues
associated with aging in FMR1 premutation carriers is needed to determine
neurodegenerative processes and establish new biobehavioral indicators to help
identify individuals at greatest risk of developing FXTAS.
METHODS: We examined postural stability in 18 premutation carriers ages
46-77 years and 14 age-matched healthy controls. Participants completed a test of
static stance and two tests of dynamic postural sway on a force platform to
quantify postural variability and complexity. CGG repeat length was measured for 
each premutation carrier, and MRI and neurological evaluations were conducted to 
identify carriers who currently met criteria for FXTAS. Of the 18 premutation
carriers, seven met criteria for definite/probable FXTAS (FXTAS+), seven showed
no MRI or neurological signs of FXTAS (FXTAS-), and four were inconclusive due to
insufficient data.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, premutation carriers showed increased center of
pressure (COP) variability in the mediolateral (COPML) direction during static
stance and reduced COP variability in the anterior-posterior (COPAP) direction
during dynamic AP sway. They also showed reductions in COPML complexity during
each postural condition. FXTAS+ individuals showed reduced COPAP variability
compared to FXTAS- carriers and healthy controls during dynamic AP sway. Across
all carriers, increased sway variability during static stance and decreased sway 
variability in target directions during dynamic sways were associated with
greater CGG repeat length and more severe neurologically rated posture and gait
abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that aging FMR1 premutation carriers show
static and dynamic postural control deficits relative to healthy controls
implicating degenerative processes of spinocerebellar and cerebellar-brainstem
circuits that may be independent of or precede the onset of FXTAS. Our finding
that FXTAS+ and FXTAS- premutation carriers differed on their level of
intentional AP sway suggests that neural mechanisms of dynamic postural control
may be differentially impacted in patients with FXTAS, and its measurement may be
useful for rapidly and precisely identifying disease presence and onset.

Behaviors.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of neurobehavioral
disorders characterized by the two core domains of behavioral deficits, including
sociability deficits and stereotyped repetitive behaviors. It is not clear
whether the core symptoms of ASD are produced by dysfunction of the overall
neural network of the brain or that of a limited brain region. Recent studies
reported that excessive glutamatergic or dopaminergic inputs in the dorsal
striatum induced sociability deficits and repetitive behaviors. These findings
suggest that the dorsal striatum plays a crucial role in autistic-like behaviors.
The present study addresses whether functional deficits of well-known ASD-related
genes in the dorsal striatum also produce ASD core symptoms. This study also
examines whether these behavioral changes can be modulated by rebalancing
glutamate and/or dopamine receptor activity in the dorsal striatum. First, we
found that the siRNA-mediated inhibition of Shank3, Nlgn3, Fmr1, Mecp2, or Tsc1
in the dorsal striatum produced mild to severe behavioral changes in sociability,
cognition, and/or repetitive behaviors. The knockdown effects of Mecp2 and Tsc1
on behavioral changes were the most prominent. Next, we demonstrated that
behavioral changes induced by striatal inhibition of MeCP2 and TSC1 were rescued 
by D-cycloserine (an NMDA agonist), fenobam (an mGluR5 antagonist), SCH23390 (a
D1 antagonist), and/or ecopipam (a D1 partial antagonist), pharmacological drugs 
that are known to regulate ASD-like symptoms in animal models. Collectively,
these results suggest that the dorsal striatum is a critical brain region that,
when dysfunctional, produces the core symptoms of ASD.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation 
and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP) in mice (Fmr1 KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation
in the hippocampus that is correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent
behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the
rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in
adult Fmr1 KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in
adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional
synaptic maturation and integration of adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) 
into hippocampal circuits is affected in Fmr1 KO mice. Here, we used retroviral
labeling to birthdate abDGCs in Fmr1 KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted
patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these
neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude
of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after
differentiation; however, this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not
altered in Fmr1 KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal
potential (E GABA) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the
development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies
systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the
first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of
GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of
FMRP.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a group of multifactorial
neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impaired social communication,
social interaction and repetitive behaviors. ASD affects 1 in 59 children, and is
about 4 times more common among boys than among girls. Strong genetic components,
together with environmental factors in the early stage of development, contribute
to the pathogenesis of ASD. Multiple studies have revealed that mutations in
genes like NRXN, NLGN, SHANK, TSC1/2, FMR1, and MECP2 converge on common cellular
pathways that intersect at synapses. These genes encode cell adhesion molecules, 
scaffolding proteins and proteins involved in synaptic transcription, protein
synthesis and degradation, affecting various aspects of synapses including
synapse formation and elimination, synaptic transmission and plasticity. This
suggests that the pathogenesis of ASD may, at least in part, be attributed to
synaptic dysfunction. In this article, we will review major genes and signaling
pathways implicated in synaptic abnormalities underlying ASD, and discuss
molecular, cellular and functional studies of ASD experimental models.

Overreactivity and defensive behaviors in response to tactile stimuli are common 
symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Similarly, somatosensory
hypersensitivity has also been described in mice lacking ASD-associated genes
such as Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation protein 1). Fmr1 knock-out mice also
show reduced functional connectivity between sensory cortical areas, which may
represent an endogenous biomarker for their hypersensitivity. Here, we measured
whole-brain functional connectivity in Engrailed-2 knock-out (En2 -/-) adult
mice, which show a lower expression of Fmr1 and anatomical defects common to Fmr1
knock-outs. MRI-based resting-state functional connectivity in adult En2 -/- mice
revealed significantly reduced synchronization in
somatosensory-auditory/associative cortices and dorsal thalamus, suggesting the
presence of aberrant somatosensory processing in these mutants. Accordingly, when
tested in the whisker nuisance test, En2 -/- but not WT mice of both sexes showed
fear behavior in response to repeated whisker stimulation. En2 -/- mice
undergoing this test exhibited decreased c-Fos-positive neurons (a marker of
neuronal activity) in layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex and increased 
immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala compared with WT littermates.
Conversely, when tested in a sensory maze, En2 -/- and WT mice spent a comparable
time in whisker-guided exploration, indicating that whisker-mediated behaviors
are otherwise preserved in En2 mutants. Therefore, fearful responses to
somatosensory stimuli in En2 -/- mice are accompanied by reduced basal
connectivity of sensory regions, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and 
increased activation of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that impaired
somatosensory processing is a common feature in mice lacking ASD-related
genes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Overreactivity to tactile stimuli is a common
symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Recent studies performed in
mice bearing ASD-related mutations confirmed these findings. Here, we evaluated
the behavioral response to whisker stimulation in mice lacking the ASD-related
gene Engrailed-2 (En2 -/- mice). Compared with WT controls, En2 -/- mice showed
reduced functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, which was paralleled
by fear behavior, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased
activation of the basolateral amygdala in response to repeated whisker
stimulation. These results suggest that impaired somatosensory signal processing 
is a common feature in mice harboring ASD-related mutations.

BACKGROUND: The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 cytogenetic region has been associated with
learning and motor delays, autism, and schizophrenia. This region includes a gene
that codes for the cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1). The CYFIP1
protein is involved in actin cytoskeletal dynamics and interacts with the fragile
X mental retardation protein. Absence of fragile X mental retardation protein
causes fragile X syndrome. Because abnormal white matter microstructure has been 
reported in both fragile X syndrome and psychiatric disorders, we looked at the
impact of 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 dosage on white matter microstructure.
METHODS: Combining a brain-wide voxel-based approach and a regional-based
analysis, we analyzed diffusion tensor imaging data from healthy individuals with
the deletion (n = 30), healthy individuals with the reciprocal duplication (n =
27), and IQ-matched control subjects with no large copy number variants (n = 19),
recruited from a large genotyped population sample.
RESULTS: We found global mirror effects (deletion > control > duplication) on
fractional anisotropy. The deletion group showed widespread increased fractional 
anisotropy when compared with duplication. Regional analyses revealed a greater
effect size in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and a tendency for
decreased fractional anisotropy in duplication.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show a reciprocal effect of 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 on white
matter microstructure, suggesting that reciprocal chromosomal imbalances may lead
to opposite changes in brain structure. Findings in the deletion overlap with
previous white matter differences reported in fragile X syndrome patients,
suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms derived from disruptions of cytoplasmic
CYFIP1-fragile X mental retardation protein complexes. Our data begin to identify
specific components of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 phenotype and neurobiological
mechanisms of potential relevance to the increased risk for disorder.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading known cause of inherited intellectual
disability and autism spectrum disorder. It is caused by a mutation of the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, resulting in a deficit of fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP). The clinical presentation of FXS is variable, 
and is typically associated with developmental delays, intellectual disability, a
wide range of behavioral issues, and certain identifying physical features. Over 
the past 25 years, researchers have worked to understand the complex relationship
between FMRP deficiency and the symptoms of FXS and, in the process, have
identified several potential targeted therapeutics, some of which have been
tested in clinical trials. Whereas most of the basic research to date has been
led by experts at academic institutions, the pharmaceutical industry is becoming 
increasingly involved with not only the scientific community, but also with
patient advocacy organizations, as more promising pharmacological agents are
moving into the clinical stages of development. The objective of this review is
to provide an industry perspective on the ongoing development of mechanism-based 
treatments for FXS, including identification of challenges and recommendations
for future clinical trials.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and genetically heterogeneous
neuropsychiatric disease affecting as many as 1 in 68 children. Large scale
genetic sequencing of individuals along the autism spectrum has uncovered several
genetic risk factors for ASD; however, understanding how, and to what extent,
individual genes contribute to the overall disease phenotype remains unclear.
Neuroimaging studies of ASD have revealed a wide spectrum of structural and
functional perturbations that are thought to reflect, in part, the complex
genetic heterogeneity underpinning ASD. These perturbations, in both preclinical 
models and clinical patients, were identified in preclinical genetic models and
ASD patients when compared to control populations; however, few studies have
directly explored intrinsic differences between the models themselves. To better 
understand the degree and extent to which individual genes associated with ASD
differ in their contribution to global measures of white matter microstructure,
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired from three novel rat genetic models
of ASD (Fmr1, Nrxn1, and Pten) and DTI parameters of fractional anisotropy, mean,
axial, and radial diffusivity were measured. Subsequent whole-brain voxel-wise
analysis comparing each genetic model to each other (Fmr1:Nrxn1; Fmr1:Pten;
Nrxn1:Pten) identified no significant differences in any comparison for all
diffusion parameters assessed (FA, AD, MD, RD).

Autism spectrum disorders are often associated with atypical sensory processing
and sensory hypersensitivity, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors, such as
tactile defensiveness. Such altered sensory perception in autism spectrum
disorders could arise from disruptions in experience-dependent maturation of
circuits during early brain development. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
synaptic structures of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons in Fragile X
syndrome (FXS), which is a common inherited cause of autism, are not modulated by
novel sensory information during development. We used chronic in vivo two-photon 
microscopy to image dendritic spines and axon "en passant" boutons of layer 2/3
pyramidal neurons in S1 of male and female WT and Fmr1 KO mice, a model of FXS.
We found that a brief (overnight) exposure to dramatically enhance sensory inputs
in the second postnatal week led to a significant increase in spine density in WT
mice, but not in Fmr1 KO mice. In contrast, axon "en passant" boutons dynamics
were impervious to this novel sensory experience in mice of both genotypes. We
surmise that the inability of Fmr1 KO mice to modulate postsynaptic dynamics in
response to increased sensory input, at a time when sensory information
processing first comes online in S1 cortex, could play a role in altered sensory 
processing in FXS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Very few longitudinal in vivo imaging
studies have investigated synaptic structure and dynamics in early postnatal
mice. Moreover, those studies tend to focus on the effects of sensory input
deprivation, a process that rarely occurs during normal brain development. Early 
postnatal imaging experiments are critical because a variety of
neurodevelopmental disorders, including those characterized by autism, could
result from alterations in how circuits are shaped by incoming sensory inputs
during critical periods of development. In this study, we focused on a mouse
model of Fragile X syndrome and demonstrate how dendritic spines are insensitive 
to a brief period of novel sensory experience.

Background: FMR1 CGG trinucleotide repeat hyper-expansions are observed in 99% of
individuals with fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS). We evaluated the
reliability of a rapid single-step gender-neutral molecular screen for FXS when
performed on DNA isolated from dried blood spots. Methods: DNA was extracted from
dried blood spots of 151 individuals with intellectual disability or autism
spectrum disorder, whose FMR1 repeat genotypes are known. Dried blood spots were 
blinded prior to DNA extraction and analysis by triplet primed PCR (TP-PCR) and
melt curve analysis (MCA). All expansion-positive and representative
expansion-negative samples were also genotyped by fluorescent TP-PCR and
capillary electrophoresis (CE) to confirm repeat expansion status. Results: Three
males and 12 females were classified as expanded by TP-PCR MCA, and were
subsequently sized by fluorescent TP-PCR CE. Two males and four females carried
premutations, while one male and eight females carried full mutations. All 19
non-expanded samples that were sized were confirmed as carrying only normal
alleles. Replicate analysis of representative expansion-positive samples yielded 
reproducible melt peak profiles. TP-PCR MCA classifications were completely
concordant with FMR1 CGG repeat genotypes. Conclusion: TP-PCR MCA of dried blood 
spot DNA accurately and reliably identifies presence/absence of FMR1 CGG repeat
expansions in both genders simultaneously. This strategy may be suitable for
rapid high-throughput first-tier screening for fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome is rare but a prominent cause of intellectual disability. It
is usually caused by a de novo mutation that occurs on multiple haplotypes and
thus would not be expected to be detectible using genome-wide association (GWA). 
We conducted GWA in 89 male FXS cases and 266 male controls, and detected
multiple genome-wide significant signals near FMR1 (odds ratio = 8.10,
P = 2.5 × 10-10). These findings withstood robust attempts at falsification.
Fine-mapping yielded a minimum P = 1.13 × 10-14, but did not narrow the interval.
Comprehensive functional genomic integration did not provide a mechanistic
hypothesis. Controls carrying a risk haplotype had significantly longer FMR1 CGG 
repeats than controls with the protective haplotype (P = 4.75 × 10-5), which may 
predispose toward increases in CGG number to the premutation range over many
generations. This is a salutary reminder of the complexity of even "simple"
monogenetic disorders.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism and intellectual
disabilities. Sensory-processing deficits are common in humans with FXS and an
animal model, the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse, manifesting in the auditory system as
debilitating hypersensitivity and abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) and
event-related potential (ERP) phenotypes. FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder,
but how EEG/ERP phenotypes change during development is unclear. Therefore, we
characterized baseline and stimulus-evoked EEG in auditory and frontal cortex of 
developing (postnatal day (P) 21 and P30) and adult (P60) wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 
KO mice with the FVB genetic background. We found that baseline gamma-band power 
and N1 amplitude of auditory ERP were increased in frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice
during development and in adults. Baseline gamma power was increased in auditory 
cortex at P30. Genotype differences in stimulus-evoked gamma power were present
in both cortical regions, but the direction and strength of the changes were
age-dependent. These findings suggest that cortical deficits are present during
early development and may contribute to sensory-processing deficits in FXS, which
in turn may lead to anxiety and delayed language. Developmental changes in EEG
measures indicate that observations at a single time-point during development are
not reflective of FXS disease progression and highlight the need to identify
developmental trajectories and optimal windows for treatment.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the full mutation (>200 CGG repeats) in the
Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. It is the most common inherited cause
of intellectual disability (ID) and autism. This review focuses on
neuropsychiatric disorders frequently experienced by premutation carriers with 55
to 200 CGG repeats and the pathophysiology involves elevated FMR1 mRNA levels,
which is different from the absence or deficiency of fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP) seen in FXS. Neuropsychiatric disorders are the most common
problems associated with the premutation, and they affect approximately 50% of
individuals with 55 to 200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Neuropsychiatric
disorders in children with the premutation include anxiety, ADHD, social
deficits, or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In adults with the premutation,
anxiety and depression are the most common problems, although obsessive
compulsive disorder, ADHD, and substance abuse are also common. These problems
are often exacerbated by chronic fatigue, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, autoimmune 
disorders and sleep problems, which are also associated with the premutation.
Here we review the clinical studies, neuropathology and molecular underpinnings
of RNA toxicity associated with the premutation. We also propose the name Fragile
X-associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND) in an effort to promote research 
and the use of fragile X DNA testing to enhance recognition and treatment for
these disorders.

Excitatory synapses are often formed at small protrusions of dendrite, called
dendritic spines, in most projection neurons, and the spine-head volumes show
strong correlations with synaptic connectivity. We examined the dynamics of spine
volume in the adult mouse visual cortex using time-lapse in vivo two-photon
imaging with a resonant Galvano scanner. Contrary to expectations, we found that 
the spines in the adult neocortex showed fluctuations to a similar degree as that
observed in young hippocampal preparations, but there were systematic differences
in how the dynamics were dependent on spine volumes, thus allowing for fewer
fluctuations in small spines, which could account for the relatively low turnover
rates of neocortical spines in vivo. We found that spine volumes fluctuated to a 
greater extent in a mouse model (Fmr1 knockout) of fragile X mental retardation
than in wild-type mice, and the spine turnover rates were also higher in Fmr1
knock-out mice. Such features of spine dynamics in Fmr1 knock-out mice could be
represented by a single slope factor in our model. Our data and model indicate a 
small but significant change in the average spine volume and more eminent
differences in the statistical distribution in Fmr1 knock-out mice even in
adulthood, which reflects the abnormal in vivo dynamics of spine volumes.

Although temperament has been studied for decades as a predictor of
psychopathology in the general population, examining temperament in neurogenetic 
groups has unique potential to inform the genetic and biological factors that may
confer risk for psychopathology in later development. The present study examined 
early temperament in two heritable neurogenetic conditions associated with
atypical CGG repeat expansions on the FMR1 gene: the FMR1 premutation (FXpm;
55-200 repeats) and fragile X syndrome (FXS; > 200 repeats). We focus
specifically on the FXpm, as the condition is highly prevalent (1:209-291 female 
individuals, 1:430-855 male individuals) and has been preliminarily associated
with increased risk for pediatric psychopathology, including attention problems, 
autism, and anxiety. In contrast, FXS is a low-incidence disorder (1:7,143 males,
1:11,111 females) often associated with intellectual disability and severe
co-occurring psychosocial conditions, particularly in male individuals. Given
information on infant clinical phenotypes in the FXpm and FXS is sparse, we aimed
to characterize parent-reported infant temperament in infants with the FXpm
(n = 22) relative to FXS (n = 24) and controls (n = 24) assessed on 1 to 3
occasions each. Temperament in infants with the FXpm largely fell between TD and 
FXS groups, with trends toward suppressed negative affect in younger
participants, similar to lower negative affect previously reported in FXS. The
FXS group consistently demonstrated lower negative affect and surgency than TD
controls. These data suggest that FMR1 gene mutations are associated with
atypical temperament that emerges as early as infancy, particularly among infants
with FXS, warranting further study of whether temperament may index emergent
clinical risks in these populations.

Premutation carriers of the FMR1 gene (CGG repeats between 55 and 200) usually
have normal intellectual abilities but approximately 20% are diagnosed with
developmental problems or autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, close to 50%
have psychiatric problems such as anxiety, ADHD and/or depression. The spectrum
of fragile X disorders also includes Fragile-X-associated primary ovarian
insufficiency (FXPOI) in female carriers and Fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia
syndrome (FXTAS) in older male and female carriers. We evaluated 25 premutation
carriers in the rural community of Ricaurte Colombia and documented all
behavioral problems, social deficits and clinical signs of FXPOI and FXTAS as
well as reviewed the medical and obstetric history. We found an increased
frequency and severity of symptoms of fragile X spectrum disorders, which might
be related to the vulnerability of FMR1 premutation carriers to higher exposure
to neurotoxic pesticides in this rural community.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability (ID) and a leading cause of autism, results from the loss of
expression of the Fmr1 gene which encodes the RNA-binding protein Fragile X
Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among the thousands mRNA targets of FMRP,
numerous encode regulators of ion homeostasis. It has also been described that
FMRP directly interacts with Ca2+ channels modulating their activity.
Collectively these findings suggest that FMRP plays critical roles in Ca2+
homeostasis during nervous system development. We carried out a functional
analysis of Ca2+ regulation using a calcium imaging approach in Fmr1-KO cultured 
neurons and we show that these cells display impaired steady state Ca2+
concentration and an altered entry of Ca2+ after KCl-triggered depolarization.
Consistent with these data, we show that the protein product of the Cacna1a gene,
the pore-forming subunit of the Cav2.1 channel, is less expressed at the plasma
membrane of Fmr1-KO neurons compared to wild-type (WT). Thus, our findings point 
out the critical role that Cav2.1 plays in the altered Ca2+ flux in Fmr1-KO
neurons, impacting Ca2+ homeostasis of these cells. Remarkably, we highlight a
new phenotype of cultured Fmr1-KO neurons that can be considered a novel cellular
biomarker and is amenable to small molecule screening and identification of new
drugs to treat FXS.

Dendritic morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity, and
calcium signaling plays a predominant role in shaping dendrites. Altered
dendritic morphology and genetic mutations in calcium signaling are both
associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study we tested the 
hypothesis that dendritic arborization and NDD-relevant behavioral phenotypes are
altered by human mutations that modulate calcium-dependent signaling pathways
implicated in NDDs. The dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in CA1
hippocampus and somatosensory cortex was quantified in Golgi-stained brain
sections from juvenile mice of both sexes expressing either a human
gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I-RYR1), a human CGG
repeat expansion (170-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1
(FMR1 premutation), both mutations (double mutation; DM), or wildtype mice. In
hippocampal neurons, increased dendritic arborization was observed in male
T4826I-RYR1 and, to a lesser extent, male FMR1 premutation neurons. Dendritic
morphology of cortical neurons was altered in both sexes of FMR1 premutation and 
DM animals with the most pronounced differences seen in DM females. Genotype also
impaired behavior, as assessed using the three-chambered social approach test.
The most striking lack of sociability was observed in DM male and female mice. In
conclusion, mutations that alter the fidelity of calcium signaling enhance
dendritic arborization in a brain region- and sex-specific manner and impair
social behavior in juvenile mice. The phenotypic outcomes of these mutations
likely provide a susceptible biological substrate for additional environmental
stressors that converge on calcium signaling to determine individual NDD risk.

The neural mechanisms of psychiatric diseases like autism spectrum disorder and
schizophrenia have been intensively studied, and a number of candidate genes have
been identified. However, the relationship between genes and neural system
functioning remains unclear. Model organisms may serve as a powerful tool for
addressing this question due to the availability of established genetic tools.
Here, we report prepulse inhibition (PPI) in Drosophila larvae for the first
time. PPI is a neurological phenomenon found in humans and other organisms and is
used in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. A weaker 
prestimulus (prepulse) inhibits the reaction to a subsequent strong, startling
stimulus (pulse). Using the larval startle response to the buzz of a predator
(wasp), we examined PPI in wild-type flies and two mutants: an fmr1 mutant, which
is implicated in Fragile X syndrome, and a centaurin gamma 1A (CenG1A) mutant,
which is associated with GTPase, PH, ArfGAP, and ANK domains and implicated in
autism. Both mutants showed decreased PPI, whereas, interestingly, double mutants
showed substantial PPI. The PPI phenomenon described here can provide a useful
tool for the study of neural mechanisms of synaptic modification and psychiatric 
diseases.

To uncover the circuit-level alterations that underlie atypical sensory
processing associated with autism, we adopted a symptom-to-circuit approach in
the Fmr1-knockout (Fmr1-/-) mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. Using a go/no-go
task and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we find that impaired visual
discrimination in Fmr1-/- mice correlates with marked deficits in orientation
tuning of principal neurons and with a decrease in the activity of parvalbumin
interneurons in primary visual cortex. Restoring visually evoked activity in
parvalbumin cells in Fmr1-/- mice with a chemogenetic strategy using designer
receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs was sufficient to rescue their 
behavioral performance. Strikingly, human subjects with Fragile X syndrome
exhibit impairments in visual discrimination similar to those in Fmr1-/- mice.
These results suggest that manipulating inhibition may help sensory processing in
Fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of heritable intellectual
disability and autism. Fragile X (Fmr1-KO) mice exhibit aberrant dendritic spine 
structure, synaptic plasticity, and cognition. Autophagy is a catabolic process
of programmed degradation and recycling of proteins and cellular components via
the lysosomal pathway. However, a role for autophagy in the pathophysiology of
FXS is, as yet, unclear. Here we show that autophagic flux, a functional readout 
of autophagy, and biochemical markers of autophagy are down-regulated in
hippocampal neurons of fragile X mice. We further show that enhanced activity of 
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and translocation of Raptor, a
defining component of mTORC1, to the lysosome are causally related to reduced
autophagy. Activation of autophagy by delivery of shRNA to Raptor directly into
the CA1 of living mice via the lentivirus expression system largely corrects
aberrant spine structure, synaptic plasticity, and cognition in fragile X mice.
Postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) and activity-regulated
cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1), proteins implicated in spine
structure and synaptic plasticity, respectively, are elevated in neurons lacking 
fragile X mental retardation protein. Activation of autophagy corrects PSD-95 and
Arc abundance, identifying a potential mechanism by which impaired autophagy is
causally related to the fragile X phenotype and revealing a previously
unappreciated role for autophagy in the synaptic and cognitive deficits
associated with fragile X syndrome.

Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of
behaviorally defined disorders and are associated with hundreds of rare genetic
mutations and several environmental risk factors. Mouse models of specific risk
factors have been successful in identifying molecular mechanisms associated with 
a given factor. However, comparisons among different models to elucidate
underlying common pathways or to define clusters of biologically relevant disease
subtypes have been complicated by different methodological approaches or
different brain regions examined by the labs that developed each model. Here, we 
use a novel proteomic technique, quantitative multiplex co-immunoprecipitation or
QMI, to make a series of identical measurements of a synaptic protein interaction
network in seven different animal models. We aim to identify molecular
disruptions that are common to multiple models.
Methods: QMI was performed on 92 hippocampal and cortical samples taken from
seven mouse models of ASD: Shank3B, Shank3Δex4-9, Ube3a2xTG, TSC2, FMR1, and
CNTNAP2 mutants, as well as E12.5 VPA (maternal valproic acid injection on day
12.5 post-conception). The QMI panel targeted a network of 16 interacting,
ASD-linked, synaptic proteins, probing 240 potential co-associations. A custom
non-parametric statistical test was used to call significant differences between 
ASD models and littermate controls, and Hierarchical Clustering by Principal
Components was used to cluster the models using mean log2 fold change values.
Results: Each model displayed a unique set of disrupted interactions, but some
interactions were disrupted in multiple models. These tended to be interactions
that are known to change with synaptic activity. Clustering revealed potential
relationships among models and suggested deficits in AKT signaling in Ube3a2xTG
mice, which were confirmed by phospho-western blots.
Conclusions: These data highlight the great heterogeneity among models, but
suggest that high-dimensional measures of a synaptic protein network may allow
differentiation of subtypes of ASD with shared molecular pathology.

Abnormal sensory processing is one of the core characteristics of the fragile X
phenotype. Studies of young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and the FMR1
premutation have shown sensory challenges as early as infancy and into early
childhood. This study sought to examine differences in sensory difficulties in
children with an FMR1 premutation compared with children with FXS and typically
developing children. We conducted an online survey of 176 parents of affected
children (FXS or FMR1 premutation). Most respondents were mothers who are
Caucasian (86%), have a 4-year college or graduate degree (68%), and are married 
(92%). Children ranged in age from 5 to 18, with a mean age of 13.0 years (3.3
SD). Participants completed the BBC Sensory Scales, a 50-item Likert-type scale
(1 = Almost Always, 4 = Almost Never) comprised of 8 subscales that assessed
auditory processing, visual processing, tactile processing, and eating and
feeding behaviors. Mean scores were calculated for the items and each of the
subscales. Non-parametric tests examined differences in child and family-level
variables. Across all BBCSS subscales, children with an FMR1 premutation
displayed more sensory challenges than typically developing children. For six out
of the eight subscales, children with the full mutation had the lowest scores
indicating more sensory challenges, but this was closely followed by children
with an FMR1 premutation. Fragile X status was associated with seven of the eight
subscales; children with an FMR1 premutation did not differ from children with
FXS on any of the subscales but had more digestive problems than children with no
fragile X. Gender, autism status, and family income were also related to sensory 
sensitivities. In conclusion, these data provide further evidence that some
children with an FMR1 premutation experience sensory difficulties that are
similar to children with FXS but different than typically developing children.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes
intellectual disability. It is a leading known genetic cause of autism. In
addition to cognitive, social, and communication deficits, humans with FXS
demonstrate abnormal sensory processing including sensory hypersensitivity.
Sensory hypersensitivity commonly manifests as auditory, tactile, or visual
defensiveness or avoidance. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological
studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity, impaired habituation to
repeated sounds, and reduced auditory attention in humans with FXS. Children with
FXS also exhibit significant visuospatial impairments. Studies in infants and
toddlers with FXS have documented impairments in processing texture-defined
motion stimuli, temporal flicker, perceiving ordinal numerical sequence, and the 
ability to maintain the identity of dynamic object information during occlusion. 
Consistent with the observations in humans with FXS, fragile X mental retardation
1 ( Fmr1) gene knockout (KO) rodent models of FXS also show seizures, abnormal
visual-evoked responses, auditory hypersensitivity, and abnormal processing at
multiple levels of the auditory system, including altered acoustic startle
responses. Among other sensory symptoms, individuals with FXS exhibit tactile
defensiveness. Fmr1 KO mice also show impaired encoding of tactile stimulation
frequency and larger size of receptive fields in the somatosensory cortex. Since 
sensory deficits are relatively more tractable from circuit mechanisms and
developmental perspectives than more complex social behaviors, the focus of this 
review is on clinical, functional, and structural studies that outline the
auditory, visual, and somatosensory processing deficits in FXS. The similarities 
in sensory phenotypes between humans with FXS and animal models suggest a likely 
conservation of basic sensory processing circuits across species and may provide 
a translational platform to not just develop biomarkers but also to understand
underlying mechanisms. We argue that preclinical studies in animal models of FXS 
can facilitate the ongoing search for new therapeutic approaches in FXS by
understanding mechanisms of basic sensory processing circuits and behaviors that 
are conserved across species.

Principal neurons encode information by varying their firing rate and patterns
precisely fine-tuned through GABAergic interneurons. Dysregulation of inhibition 
can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders, yet little is known about the molecular
basis underlying inhibitory control. Here, we find that excessive GABA release
from basket cells (BCs) attenuates the firing frequency of Purkinje neurons (PNs)
in the cerebellum of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout (KO) mice, a 
model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) with abrogated expression of the Fragile X
Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). This over-inhibition originates from increased
excitability and Ca2+ transients in the presynaptic terminals, where Kv1.2
potassium channels are downregulated. By paired patch-clamp recordings, we
further demonstrate that acutely introducing an N-terminal fragment of FMRP into 
BCs normalizes GABA release in the Fmr1-KO synapses. Conversely, direct injection
of an inhibitory FMRP antibody into BCs, or membrane depolarization of BCs,
enhances GABA release in the wild type synapses, leading to abnormal inhibitory
transmission comparable to the Fmr1-KO neurons. We discover that the N-terminus
of FMRP directly binds to a phosphorylated serine motif on the C-terminus of
Kv1.2; and that loss of this interaction in BCs exaggerates GABA release,
compromising the firing activity of PNs and thus the output from the cerebellar
circuitry. An allosteric Kv1.2 agonist, docosahexaenoic acid, rectifies the
dysregulated inhibition in vitro as well as acoustic startle reflex and social
interaction in vivo of the Fmr1-KO mice. Our results unravel a novel molecular
locus for targeted intervention of FXS and perhaps autism.

The fragile X mental retardation 1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mouse replicates behavioral
deficits associated with autism, fragile X syndrome, and schizophrenia. Less is
known whether protein expression changes are consistent with findings in subjects
with schizophrenia. In the current study, we used liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics to determine the protein expression of
four subcellular fractions in the forebrains of Fmr1 KO mice vs. C57BL/6 J mice
and the effect of a negative allosteric modulator of
mGluR5-2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP)-on protein expression. Strain-
and treatment-specific differential expression of proteins was observed, many of 
which have previously been observed in the brains of subjects with schizophrenia.
Western blotting verified the direction and magnitude of change for several
proteins in different subcellular fractions as follows: neurofilament light
protein (NEFL) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) in the
total homogenate; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2 (HNRNPC) and
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D0 (HNRNPD) in the nuclear fraction;
excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and ras-related protein rab 3a
(RAB3A) in the synaptic fraction; and ras-related protein rab 35 (RAB35) and
neuromodulin (GAP43) in the rough endoplasmic reticulum fraction. Individuals
with FXS do not display symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the biomarkers that
have been identified suggest that the Fmr1 KO model could potentially be useful
in the study of schizophrenia.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability and autism. It results from expansion of a CGG nucleotide repeat in
the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of FMR1. Large expansions elicit repeat and
promoter hyper-methylation, heterochromatin formation, FMR1 transcriptional
silencing and loss of the Fragile X protein, FMRP. Efforts aimed at correcting
the sequelae resultant from FMRP loss have thus far proven insufficient, perhaps 
because of FMRP's pleiotropic functions. As the repeats do not disrupt the FMRP
coding sequence, reactivation of endogenous FMR1 gene expression could correct
the proximal event in FXS pathogenesis. Here we utilize the Clustered Regularly
Interspaced Palindromic Repeats/deficient CRISPR associated protein 9
(CRISPR/dCas9) system to selectively re-activate transcription from the silenced 
FMR1 locus. Fusion of the transcriptional activator VP192 to dCas9 robustly
enhances FMR1 transcription and increases FMRP levels when targeted directly to
the CGG repeat in human cells. Using a previously uncharacterized FXS human
embryonic stem cell (hESC) line which acquires transcriptional silencing with
serial passaging, we achieved locus-specific transcriptional re-activation of
FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression despite promoter and repeat methylation.
However, these changes at the transcript level were not coupled with a
significant elevation in FMRP protein expression in FXS cells. These studies
demonstrate that directing a transcriptional activator to CGG repeats is
sufficient to selectively reactivate FMR1 mRNA expression in Fragile X patient
stem cells.

The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein
involved in translational regulation of mRNAs that play key roles in synaptic
morphology and plasticity. The functional absence of FMRP causes the fragile X
syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the
most common monogenic cause of autism. No effective treatment is available for
FXS. We recently identified the Phosphodiesterase 2A (Pde2a) mRNA as a prominent 
target of FMRP. PDE2A enzymatic activity is increased in the brain of Fmr1-KO
mice, a recognized model of FXS, leading to decreased levels of cAMP and cGMP.
Here, we pharmacologically inhibited PDE2A in Fmr1-KO mice and observed a rescue 
both of the maturity of dendritic spines and of the exaggerated hippocampal
mGluR-dependent long-term depression. Remarkably, PDE2A blockade rescued the
social and communicative deficits of both mouse and rat Fmr1-KO animals.
Importantly, chronic inhibition of PDE2A in newborn Fmr1-KO mice followed by a
washout interval, resulted in the rescue of the altered social behavior observed 
in adolescent mice. Altogether, these results reveal the key role of PDE2A in the
physiopathology of FXS and suggest that its pharmacological inhibition represents
a novel therapeutic approach for FXS.

Sensory processing dysfunction (SPD) is present in most patients with
intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Silencing
expression of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene leads to Fragile X
syndrome (FXS), the most common single gene cause of ID and ASD. Drosophila have 
a highly conserved FMR1 ortholog, dfmr1. dfmr1 mutants display cognitive and
social defects reminiscent of symptoms seen in individuals with FXS. We utilized 
a robust behavioral assay for sensory processing of the Drosophila stress odorant
(dSO) to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of SPD in FXS. Here, 
we show that dfmr1 mutant flies present significant defects in dSO response. We
found that dfmr1 expression in mushroom bodies is required for dSO processing. We
also show that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling via PKA is
activated after exposure to dSO and that several drugs regulating both cAMP and
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels significantly improved defects in
dSO processing in dfmr1 mutant flies.

KEY POINTS: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic condition that is the most
common form of inherited intellectual impairment and causes a range of
neurodevelopmental complications including learning disabilities and intellectual
disability and shares many characteristics with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
In the FXS mouse model, Fmr1-/y , impaired synaptic plasticity was restored by
pharmacologically inhibiting GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors but not
GluN2B-containing receptors. Similar results were obtained by crossing Fmr1-/y
with GluN2A knock-out (Grin2A-/- ) mice. These results suggest that dampening the
elevated levels of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors in Fmr1-/y mice has the
potential to restore hyperexcitability of the neural circuitry to (a more)
normal-like level of brain activity.
ABSTRACT: NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in synaptic plasticity at 
central excitatory synapses, and dysregulation of their function may lead to
severe disorders such Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is caused by transcriptional 
silencing of the FMR1 gene followed by lack of the encoding protein. Here we
examined the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulation of hippocampal
NMDAR functions in long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). We found
impaired NMDAR-dependent LTP in the Fmr1-deficient mice, which could be fully
restored when GluN2A-containing NMDARs was pharmacological inhibited.
Interestingly, similar LTP effects were observed when the GluN2A gene (Grin2a)
was deleted in Fmr1-/y mice (Fmr1-/y /Grin2a-/- double knockout). In addition,
GluN2A inhibition improved elevated mGluR5-dependent LTD to normal level in the
Fmr1-/y mouse. These findings suggest that GluN2A is a promising target in FXS
research that could help us better understand the disorder.

An outstanding question in developmental neurobiology is how RNA processing
events contribute to the regulation of neurogenesis. RNA processing events are
increasingly recognized as playing fundamental roles in regulating multiple
developmental events during neurogenesis, from the asymmetric divisions of neural
stem cells, to the generation of complex and diverse neurite morphologies.
Indeed, both asymmetric cell division and neurite morphogenesis are often
achieved by mechanisms that generate asymmetric protein distributions, including 
post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms such as the transport of
translationally silent messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and local translation of mRNAs
within neurites. Additionally, defects in RNA splicing have emerged as a common
theme in many neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of RNA
processing in maintaining neuronal circuitry. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play an
integral role in splicing and post-transcriptional gene regulation, and mutations
in RBPs have been linked with multiple neurological disorders including autism,
dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA),
Fragile X syndrome (FXS), and X-linked intellectual disability disorder. Despite 
their widespread nature and roles in neurological disease, the molecular
mechanisms and networks of regulated target RNAs have been defined for only a
small number of specific RBPs. This review aims to highlight recent studies in
Drosophila that have advanced our knowledge of how RBP dysfunction contributes to
neurological disease.

Mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) cause the most common
inherited human autism spectrum disorder. FMR1 influences messenger RNA (mRNA)
translation, but identifying functional targets has been difficult. We analyzed
quiescent Drosophila oocytes, which, like neural synapses, depend heavily on
translating stored mRNA. Ribosome profiling revealed that FMR1 enhances rather
than represses the translation of mRNAs that overlap previously identified FMR1
targets, and acts preferentially on large proteins. Human homologs of at least 20
targets are associated with dominant intellectual disability, and 30 others with 
recessive neurodevelopmental dysfunction. Stored oocytes lacking FMR1 usually
generate embryos with severe neural defects, unlike stored wild-type oocytes,
which suggests that translation of multiple large proteins by stored mRNAs is
defective in fragile X syndrome and possibly other autism spectrum disorders.

Pragmatic language skills exist across a continuum in typical and clinical
populations, and are impaired in many neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably 
autism. The mechanisms underlying pragmatic impairment are poorly understood,
although theory suggests dampened vagal tone plays a role. This study
investigated the FMR1 premutation as a genetic model that may lend insight into
the relationship between vagal function and pragmatic ability. Participants
included 38 women with the FMR1 premutation and 23 controls. Vagal tone accounted
for significant variance in pragmatics across both groups and statistically
mediated the effect of FMR1 premutation status on pragmatic ability. Results
support vagal tone as a biophysiological correlate of pragmatic ability, which
informs potential mechanistic underpinnings and could have implications for
targeted treatment.

Are FXR Family Proteins Integrators of Dopamine Signaling and Glutamatergic
Neurotransmission in Mental Illnesses?

Dopamine receptors and related signaling pathways have long been implicated in
pathophysiology and treatment of mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder. Dopamine signaling may impact neuronal activity by modulation
of glutamate neurotransmission. Recent evidence indicates a direct and/or
indirect involvement of fragile X-related family proteins (FXR) in the regulation
and mediation of dopamine receptor functions. FXRs consists of fragile X mental
retardation protein 1 (Fmr1/FMRP) and its autosomal homologs Fxr1 and Fxr2. These
RNA-binding proteins are enriched in the brain. Loss of function mutation in
human FMR1 is the major genetic contributor to Fragile X mental retardation
syndrome. Therefore, the role of FXR proteins has mostly been studied in the
context of autism spectrum disorders. However, recent genome-wide association
studies have linked this family to schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and mood
regulation pointing toward a broader involvement in mental illnesses. FXR family 
proteins play an important role in the regulation of glutamate-mediated neuronal 
activity and plasticity. Here, we discuss the brain-specific functions of FXR
family proteins by focusing on the regulation of dopamine receptor functions,
ionotropic glutamate receptors-mediated synaptic plasticity and contribution to
mental illnesses. Based on recent evidence, we propose that FXR proteins are
potential integrators of dopamine signaling and ionotropic glutamate
transmission.

The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1)-related disorder fragile X
syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of cognitive impairment and the 
second most common cause of comorbid autism. FXS usually results when a
premutation trinucleotide CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1
gene (CGG 55-200) expands over generations to a full mutation allele (CGG >200). 
This expansion is associated with silencing of the FMR1 promoter via an
epigenetic mechanism that involves DNA methylation of the CGG repeat and the
surrounding regulatory regions. Decrease in FMR1 transcription is associated with
loss of the FMR1 protein that is needed for typical brain development. The past
decade has seen major advances in our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic
processes that underlie FXS. Here we review these advances and their implications
for diagnosis and treatment for individuals who have FMR1-related disorders. WHAT
THIS PAPER ADDS: Improved analysis of DNA methylation allows better epigenetic
evaluation of the fragile X gene. New testing techniques have unmasked
interindividual variation among children with fragile X syndrome. New testing
methods have also detected additional cases of fragile X.

Background: Loss of FMR1 is associated with Fragile X syndrome, amongst the most 
prevalent inherited intellectual disability. Despite extensive research in this
area, previous studies have failed to detect consistent evidence of cognitive
impairments in the Morris water maze (MWM) task in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse. 
However, few studies have examined cognitive flexibility in a reversal form of
the MWM task, which may illuminate subtle learning deficits. Methods: Adult male 
Fmr1 wildtype (WT) and KO mice were bred and tested in the MWM reversal paradigm.
The testing paradigm consisted of two blocks per day, with 4 trials per block to 
locate a hidden platform. After the last trials on the fourth day of testing, the
animals were given a probe trial with the platform removed. The following week,
the location of the platform was switched to the opposite quadrant and the
animals received 2 more days of testing, with 4 blocks in total. Results: As
expected, Fmr1 KO mice did not display a learning deficit during the acquisition 
phase, F genotype (1, 24) = 0.034, p = 0.854, and performed similarly on the
probe trial, F genotype (1, 23) = 0.024, p = 0.877. However, during the reversal 
phase of learning, Fmr1 KO mice showed deficits in their ability to learn the new
location of the platform, F genotype (1, 23) = 3.93, p = 0.059. Further
independent samples t-testing revealed that KO animals displayed significantly
higher latency to reach the hidden platform during the third trial, t(23) =
-2.96, p < 0.01. Conclusions: While previous studies have not demonstrated
deficits in spatial memory in the Fmr1 KO model, it is possible that the
acquisition phase of the task is less sensitive to deficits in learning. Future
studies using this model to evaluate therapeutic interventions should consider
utilizing the MWM reversal paradigm.

Neuroligins (NLGNs) are cell adhesion molecules located on the postsynaptic side 
of the synapse that interact with their presynaptic partners neurexins to
maintain trans-synaptic connection. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common
neurodevelopmental disease that often co-occurs with autism and is caused by the 
lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. To gain an
insight into the molecular interactions between the autism-related genes, we
sought to determine whether FMRP controls the synaptic levels of NLGNs. We show
evidences that FMRP associates with Nlgn1, Nlgn2, and Nlgn3 mRNAs in vitro in
both synaptoneurosomes and neuronal cultures. Next, we confirm local translation 
of Nlgn1, Nlgn2, and Nlgn3 mRNAs to be synaptically regulated by FMRP. As a
consequence of elevated Nlgns mRNA translation Fmr1 KO mice exhibit increased
incorporation of NLGN1 and NLGN3 into the postsynaptic membrane. Finally, we show
that neuroligins synaptic level is precisely and dynamically regulated by their
rapid proteolytic cleavage upon NMDA receptor stimulation in both wild type and
Fmr1 KO mice. In aggregate, our study provides a novel approach to understand the
molecular basis of FXS by linking the dysregulated synaptic expression of NLGNs
with FMRP.

Neurodevelopmental disorders are defined by highly heritable problems during
development and brain growth. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and intellectual disability (ID) are frequent
neurodevelopmental disorders, with common comorbidity among them. Imaging
genetics studies on the role of disease-linked genetic variants on brain
structure and function have been performed to unravel the etiology of these
disorders. Here, we reviewed imaging genetics literature on these disorders
attempting to understand the mechanisms of individual disorders and their
clinical overlap. For ADHD and ASD, we selected replicated candidate genes
implicated through common genetic variants. For ID, which is mainly caused by
rare variants, we included genes for relatively frequent forms of ID occurring
comorbid with ADHD or ASD. We reviewed case-control studies and studies of risk
variants in healthy individuals. Imaging genetics studies for ADHD were retrieved
for SLC6A3/DAT1, DRD2, DRD4, NOS1, and SLC6A4/5HTT. For ASD, studies on CNTNAP2, 
MET, OXTR, and SLC6A4/5HTT were found. For ID, we reviewed the genes FMR1, TSC1
and TSC2, NF1, and MECP2. Alterations in brain volume, activity, and connectivity
were observed. Several findings were consistent across studies, implicating, for 
example, SLC6A4/5HTT in brain activation and functional connectivity related to
emotion regulation. However, many studies had small sample sizes, and
hypothesis-based, brain region-specific studies were common. Results from
available studies confirm that imaging genetics can provide insight into the link
between genes, disease-related behavior, and the brain. However, the field is
still in its early stages, and conclusions about shared mechanisms cannot yet be 
drawn.

In vivo optical imaging is a powerful tool for revealing brain structure and
function at both the circuit and cellular levels. Here, we provide a systematic
review of findings obtained from in vivo imaging studies of mouse models of
neurodevelopmental disorders, including the monogenic disorders fragile X
syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome, which are caused by genetic
abnormalities of FMR1, MECP2, and UBE3A, as well as disorders caused by copy
number variations (15q11-13 duplication and 22q11.2 deletion) and BTBR mice as an
inbred strain model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most studies visualize the
structural and functional responsiveness of cerebral cortical neurons to sensory 
stimuli and the developmental and experience-dependent changes in these responses
as a model of brain functions affected by these disorders. The optical imaging
techniques include two-photon microscopy of fluorescently labeled dendritic
spines or neurons loaded with fluorescent calcium indicators and macroscopic
imaging of cortical activity using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes or 
intrinsic optical signals. Studies have revealed alterations in the density,
stability, and turnover of dendritic spines, aberrant cortical sensory responses,
impaired inhibitory function, and concomitant failure of circuit maturation as
common causes for neurological deficits. Mechanistic hypotheses derived from in
vivo imaging also provide new directions for therapeutic interventions. For
instance, it was recently demonstrated that early postnatal administration of a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) restores impaired cortical
inhibitory function and ameliorates the aberrant social behaviors in a mouse
model of ASD. We discuss the potential use of SSRIs for treating ASDs in light of
these findings.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of complex neurodevelopmental disorders
for which there is currently no targeted therapeutic approach. It is thought that
alterations of genes regulating migration and synapse formation during
development affect neural circuit formation and result in aberrant connectivity
within distinct circuits that underlie abnormal behaviors. However, it is unknown
whether deviant developmental trajectories are circuit-specific for a given
autism risk-gene. We used MRI to probe changes in functional and structural
connectivity from childhood to adulthood in Fragile-X (Fmr1-/y) and
contactin-associated (CNTNAP2-/-) knockout mice. Young Fmr1-/y mice (30 days
postnatal) presented with a robust hypoconnectivity phenotype in corticocortico
and corticostriatal circuits in areas associated with sensory information
processing, which was maintained until adulthood. Conversely, only small
differences in hippocampal and striatal areas were present during early postnatal
development in CNTNAP2-/- mice, while major connectivity deficits in prefrontal
and limbic pathways developed between adolescence and adulthood. These findings
are supported by viral tracing and electron micrograph approaches and define 2
clearly distinct connectivity endophenotypes within the autism spectrum. We
conclude that the genetic background of ASD strongly influences which circuits
are most affected, the nature of the phenotype, and the developmental time course
of the associated changes.

Social withdrawal is one phenotypic feature of the monogenic neurodevelopmental
disorder fragile-X. Using a 'knockout' rat model of fragile-X, we examined
whether deletion of the Fmr1 gene that causes this condition would affect the
ability to form and express a social hierarchy as measured in a tube test. Male
fragile-X 'knockout' rats living together could successfully form a social
dominance hierarchy, but were significantly subordinate to wild-type animals in
mixed group cages. Over 10 days of repeated testing, the fragile-X mutant rats
gradually showed greater variance and instability of rank during their tube-test 
encounters. This affected the outcome of future encounters with stranger animals 
from other cages, with the initial phenotype of wild-type dominance lost to a
more complex picture that reflected, regardless of genotype, the prior experience
of winning or losing. Our findings offer a novel insight into the complex
dynamics of social interactions between laboratory living groups of fragile-X and
wild-type rats. Even though this is a monogenic condition, experience has an
impact upon future interactions with other animals. Gene/environment interactions
should therefore be considered in the development of therapeutics.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-chromosome linked intellectual disability and
the most common known inherited single gene cause of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Building upon demonstrated deficits in neuronal plasticity and spatial
memory in FXS, we investigated how spatial information processing is affected in 
vivo in an FXS mouse model (Fmr1-KO). Healthy hippocampal neurons (so-called
place cells) exhibit place-related activity during spatial exploration, and their
firing fields tend to remain stable over time. In contrast, we find impaired
stability and reduced specificity of Fmr1-KO spatial representations. This is a
potential biomarker for the cognitive dysfunction observed in FXS, informative on
the ability to integrate sensory information into an abstract representation and 
successfully retain this conceptual memory. Our results provide key insight into 
the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive disabilities in FXS and ASD,
paving the way for a targeted approach to remedy these.

The sodium-activated potassium channel Slack (Slo2.2) is widely expressed in
central and peripheral neurons where it is supposed to shape firing properties
important for neuronal excitability. Slack activity is enhanced by interaction
with the Fragile-X-Mental-Retardation-Protein (FMRP) and loss of FMRP leads to
decreased sodium-activated potassium currents in medial nucleus of the trapezoid 
body neurons of the Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse representing a mouse model of the
human Fragile-X-Syndrome (FXS) and autism. Autism is a frequent comorbidity of
FXS, but it is unclear whether Slack is involved in autistic or related
conditions of FXS in vivo. By applying a wide range of behavioral tests, we
compared social and autism-related behaviors in Slack- and FMRP-deficient mice.
In our hands, as expected, FMRP-deficiency causes autism-related behavioral
changes in nesting and in a marble-burying test. In contrast, Slack-deficient
males exhibited specific abnormalities in sociability in direct and indirect
social interaction tests. Hence, we show for the first time that a proper Slack
channel function is mandatory for normal social behavior in mice. Nevertheless,
as deficits in social behaviors seem to occur independently from each other in
FMRP and Slack null mutants, we conclude that Slack is not involved in the
autistic phenotype of FMRP KO mice.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability and the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. It has
previously been demonstrated that prenatal genetic diagnosis is efficient for the
diagnosis of FXS. The present study investigated the diagnostic effects of nested
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) and
expanded CGG repeats. It was demonstrated that the nested PCR assay rapidly
measured the multi-copies of the FMR1 gene in individual samples. The nested PCR 
assay detected normal CGG repeat lengths and expanded CGG repeat lengths with a
low occurrence of false positives. In addition, the nested PCR assay resulted in 
increased sensitivity and specificity for patients with FXS. Furthermore, the
nested PCR assay identified the mutation and generated conclusive cases for FXS, 
indicating that this assay is beneficial for the diagnosis of FXS patients. In
conclusion, these outcomes indicate that nested PCR assay is a reliable and
easier method for diagnosis of FXS, which may be used for the diagnosis of FXS
patients.

The fragile X syndrome (FXS) arises from loss of expression or function of the
FMR1 gene and is one of the most common monogenic forms of intellectual
disability and autism. During the past two decades of FXS research, the fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP) has been primarily characterized as a
cytoplasmic RNA binding protein that facilitates transport of select RNA
substrates through neural projections and regulation of translation within
synaptic compartments, with the protein products of such mRNAs then modulating
cognitive functions. However, the presence of a small fraction of FMRP in the
nucleus has long been recognized. Accordingly, recent studies have uncovered
several mechanisms or pathways by which FMRP influences nuclear gene expression
and genome function. Some of these pathways appear to be independent of the
classical role for FMRP as a regulator of translation and point to novel
functions, including the possibility that FMRP directly participates in the DNA
damage response and in the maintenance of genome stability. In this review, we
highlight these advances and discuss how these new findings could contribute to
our understanding of FMRP in brain development and function, the neural pathology
of fragile X syndrome, and perhaps impact of future therapeutic considerations.

INTRODUCTION: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common monogenetic cause of
intellectual disability, autism spectrum features, and a broad range of other
psychiatric and medical problems. FXS is caused by the lack of the fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP), a translational regulator of specific mRNAs at
the postsynaptic compartment. The absence of FMRP leads to aberrant synaptic
plasticity, which is believed to be caused by an imbalance in excitatory and
inhibitory network functioning of the synapse. Evidence from studies in mice
demonstrates that GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and
its receptors, is involved in the pathogenesis of FXS. Moreover, several FXS
phenotypes, including social behavior deficits, could be corrected in Fmr1 KO
mice after acute treatment with GABAB agonists.
METHODS: As FXS would probably require a lifelong treatment, we investigated the 
effect of chronic treatment with the GABAB agonist baclofen on social behavior in
Fmr1 KO mice on two behavioral paradigms for social behavior: the automated tube 
test and the three-chamber sociability test.
RESULTS: Unexpectedly, chronic baclofen treatment resulted in worsening of the
FXS phenotypes in these behavior tests. Strikingly, baclofen treatment also
affected wild-type animals in both behavioral tests, inducing a phenotype similar
to that of untreated Fmr1 KO mice.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, the disappointing results of recent clinical trials with 
the R-baclofen enantiomer arbaclofen and our current results indicate that
baclofen should be reconsidered and further evaluated before its application in
targeted treatment for FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable cause of intellectual
disability and single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. The Fmr1 null mouse
models much of the human disease including hyperarousal, sensory
hypersensitivity, seizure activity, and hippocampus-dependent cognitive
impairment. Sleep architecture is disorganized in FXS patients, but has not been 
examined in Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mice. Hippocampal neural activity during
sleep, which is implicated in memory processing, also remains uninvestigated in
Fmr1-KO mice. We performed in vivo electrophysiological studies of freely
behaving Fmr1-KO mice to assess neural activity, in the form of single-unit
spiking and local field potential (LFP), within the hippocampal CA1 region during
multiple differentiated sleep and wake states. Here, we demonstrate that Fmr1-KO 
mice exhibited a deficit in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) due to a reduction in 
the frequency of bouts of REM, consistent with sleep architecture abnormalities
of FXS patients. Fmr1-KO CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1-PCs) were hyperactive in all
sleep and wake states. Increased low gamma power in CA1 suggests that this
hyperactivity was related to increased input to CA1 from CA3. By contrast, slower
sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs) in Fmr1-KO mice exhibited longer event duration, 
slower oscillation frequency, with reduced CA1-PC firing rates during SWRs, yet
the incidence rate of SWRs remained intact. These results suggest abnormal
neuronal activity in the Fmr1-KO mouse during SWRs, and hyperactivity during
other wake and sleep states, with likely adverse consequences for memory
processes.

Synaptic scaling allows neurons to homeostatically readjust synaptic strength
upon chronic neural activity perturbations. Although altered synaptic scaling has
been implicated to underlie imbalanced brain excitability in neurological
disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy, the molecular
dysregulation and restoration of synaptic scaling in those diseases have not been
demonstrated. Here, we showed that the homeostatic synaptic downscaling is absent
in the hippocampal neurons of Fmr1 KO mice, the mouse model of the most common
inherited autism, fragile X syndrome (FXS). We found that the impaired
homeostatic synaptic downscaling in Fmr1 KO neurons is caused by loss-of-function
dephosphorylation of an epilepsy-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, neural precursor
cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-2, Nedd4-2. Such
dephosphorylation of Nedd4-2 is surprisingly caused by abnormally stable tumor
suppressor p53 and subsequently destabilized kinase Akt. Dephosphorylated Nedd4-2
fails to elicit 14-3-3-dependent ubiquitination and down-regulation of the GluA1 
subunit of AMPA receptor, and therefore impairs synaptic downscaling. Most
importantly, using a pharmacological inhibitor of p53, Nedd4-2 phosphorylation,
GluA1 ubiquitination and synaptic downscaling are all restored in Fmr1 KO
neurons. Together, our results discover a novel cellular mechanism underlying
synaptic downscaling, and demonstrate the dysregulation and successful
restoration of this mechanism in the FXS mouse model.

Intellectual disability (ID) and autism are hallmarks of Fragile X Syndrome
(FXS), a hereditary neurodevelopmental disorder. The gene responsible for FXS is 
Fragile X Mental Retardation gene 1 (FMR1) encoding the Fragile X Mental
Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in RNA metabolism and
modulating the expression level of many targets. Most cases of FXS are caused by 
silencing of FMR1 due to CGG expansions in the 5'-UTR of the gene. Humans also
carry the FXR1 and FXR2 paralogs of FMR1 while flies have only one FMR1 gene,
here called dFMR1, sharing the same level of sequence homology with all three
human genes, but functionally most similar to FMR1. This enables a much easier
approach for FMR1 genetic studies. Drosophila has been widely used to investigate
FMR1 functions at genetic, cellular, and molecular levels since dFMR1 mutants
have many phenotypes in common with the wide spectrum of FMR1 functions that
underlay the disease. In this review, we present very recent Drosophila studies
investigating FMRP functions at genetic, cellular, molecular, and
electrophysiological levels in addition to research on pharmacological treatments
in the fly model. These studies have the potential to aid the discovery of
pharmacological therapies for FXS.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and
the most frequent monogenic cause of syndromic autism spectrum disorders. The
syndrome is caused by the loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein
(FMRP), a key RNA-binding protein involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal
morphology. Patients show intellectual disability, social deficits, repetitive
behaviors and impairments in social communication. The aim of this review is to
outline the importance of behavioral phenotyping of animal models of FXS from a
developmental perspective, by showing how the behavioral characteristics of FXS
at the clinical level can be translated into effective, developmentally-specific 
and clinically meaningful behavioral readouts in the laboratory setting. After
introducing the behavioral features, diagnostic criteria and off-label
pharmacotherapy of FXS, we outline how FXS-relevant behavioral features can be
modelled in laboratory animals in the course of development: we review the
progress to date, discuss how behavioral phenotyping in animal models of FXS is
essential to identify potential treatments, and discuss caveats and future
directions in this research field.

The presence of dynamic mutation in the FMR1 gene localized on the X chromosome
(Xq28) is the major cause of Fragile X syndrome. As this syndrome is quite
frequently diagnosed in patients with intellectual disability and autism spectrum
disorders, the genetic testing of the FMR1 gene is a routine procedure performed 
in these patients. Molecular methods based on the PCR technique are used
commonly, as they allow to identify normal (up to 54 CGG repeats, including grey 
zone alleles - 45-54 CGG repeats), premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) and full
mutation (>200 CGG repeats) alleles.The article presents the basic methods used
in the molecular diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome and other FMR1-related
disorders. The following methods are presented: a screening test with GeneScan
analysis, TP-PCR based tests and methods used for methylation analysis. Their
pros and cons, as well as the resulting interpretation are discussed. Moreover,
there is a presentation of the molecular diagnostic scheme following European
Molecular Genetics Quality Network guidelines used in the Department of Medical
Genetics.

Identification of comparable biomarkers in humans and validated animal models
will facilitate pre-clinical to clinical therapeutic pipelines to treat
neurodevelopmental disorders. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading known genetic
cause of intellectual disability with symptoms that include increased anxiety,
social and sensory processing deficits. Recent EEG studies in humans with FXS
have identified neural oscillation deficits that include enhanced resting state
gamma power and reduced inter-trial coherence of sound evoked gamma oscillations.
To determine if analogous phenotypes are present in an animal model of FXS, we
recorded EEGs in awake, freely moving Fmr1 knock out (KO) mice using similar
stimuli as in the human studies. We report remarkably similar neural oscillation 
phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse including enhanced resting state gamma power and 
reduced evoked gamma synchronization. The gamma band inter-trial coherence of
neural response was reduced in both auditory and frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice
stimulated with a sound whose envelope was modulated from 1 to 100 Hz, similar to
that seen in humans with FXS. These deficits suggest a form of enhanced 'resting 
state noise' that interferes with the ability of the circuit to mount a
synchronized response to sensory input, predicting specific sensory and cognitive
deficits in FXS. The abnormal gamma oscillations are consistent with parvalbumin 
neuron and perineuronal net deficits seen in the Fmr1 KO mouse auditory cortex
indicating that the EEG biomarkers are not only clinically relevant, but could
also be used to probe cellular and circuit mechanisms of sensory hypersensitivity
in FXS.

Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.

The Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common forms of inherited
intellectual disability in all human societies. Caused by the transcriptional
silencing of a single gene, the fragile x mental retardation gene FMR1, FXS is
characterized by a variety of symptoms, which range from mental disabilities to
autism and epilepsy. More than 20 years ago, a first animal model was described, 
the Fmr1 knock-out mouse. Several other models have been developed since then,
including conditional knock-out mice, knock-out rats, a zebrafish and a
drosophila model. Using these model systems, various targets for potential
pharmaceutical treatments have been identified and many treatments have been
shown to be efficient in preclinical studies. However, all attempts to turn these
findings into a therapy for patients have failed thus far. In this review, I will
discuss underlying difficulties and address potential alternatives for our future
research.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic form of intellectual disability and
autism spectrum disorder caused by the absence of the fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP). In biological models for the disease, this leads to
upregulated mRNA translation and as a consequence, deficits in synaptic
architecture and plasticity. Preclinical studies revealed that pharmacological
interventions restore those deficits, which are thought to mediate the FXS
cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Here, we characterized the de novo rate of
protein synthesis in patients with FXS and their relationship with clinical
severity. We measured the rate of protein synthesis in fibroblasts derived from
32 individuals with FXS and from 17 controls as well as in fibroblasts and
primary neurons of 27 Fmr1 KO mice and 20 controls. Here, we show that levels of 
protein synthesis are increased in fibroblasts of individuals with FXS and Fmr1
KO mice. However, this cellular phenotype displays a broad distribution and a
proportion of fragile X individuals and Fmr1 KO mice do not show increased levels
of protein synthesis, having measures in the normal range. Because the same Fmr1 
KO animal measures in fibroblasts predict those in neurons we suggest the
validity of this peripheral biomarker. Our study offers a potential explanation
for the comprehensive drug development program undertaken thus far yielding
negative results and suggests that a significant proportion, but not all
individuals with FXS, may benefit from the reduction of excessive levels of
protein synthesis.

Neuronal networks can synchronize their activity through excitatory and
inhibitory connections, which is conducive to synaptic plasticity. This
synchronization is reflected in rhythmic fluctuations of the extracellular field.
In the hippocampus, theta and gamma band LFP oscillations are a hallmark of the
processing of spatial information and memory. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an
intellectual disability and the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum
disorder (Belmonte and Bourgeron, 2006). Here, we investigated how neuronal
network synchronization in the mouse hippocampus is compromised by the Fmr1
mutation that causes FXS (Santos et al., 2014), relating recently observed
single-cell level impairments (Arbab et al., 2017) to neuronal network
aberrations. We implanted tetrodes in hippocampus of freely moving Fmr1-KO and
littermate wildtype (WT) mice (Mientjes et al., 2006), to record spike trains
from multiple, isolated neurons as well as LFPs in a spatial exploration
paradigm. Compared to wild type mice, Fmr1-KO mice displayed greater power of
hippocampal theta oscillations, and higher coherence in the slow gamma band.
Additionally, spike trains of Fmr1-KO interneurons show decreased spike-count
correlations and they are hypersynchronized with theta and slow gamma
oscillations. The hypersynchronization of Fmr1-KO oscillations and spike timing
reflects functional deficits in local networks. This network hypersynchronization
pathologically decreases the heterogeneity of spike-LFP phase coupling,
compromising information processing within the hippocampal circuit. These
findings may reflect a pathophysiological mechanism explaining cognitive
impairments in FXS and autism, in which there is anomalous processing of social
and environmental cues and associated deficits in memory and cognition.

Increased intragenic DNA methylation of the Fragile X Related Epigenetic Element 
2 (FREE2) in blood has been correlated with lower intellectual functioning in
females with fragile X syndrome (FXS). This study explored these relationships in
a paediatric cohort of males with FXS using Buccal Epithelial Cells (BEC). BEC
were collected from 25 males with FXS, aged 3 to 17 years and 19 age-matched male
controls without FXS. Methylation of 9 CpG sites within the FREE2 region was
examined using the EpiTYPER approach. Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) scores of males with
FXS were corrected for floor effect using the Whitaker and Gordon (WG)
extrapolation method. Compared to controls, children with FXS had significant
higher methylation levels for all CpG sites examined (p < 3.3 × 10-7), and within
the FXS group, lower FSIQ (WG corrected) was associated with higher levels of DNA
methylation, with the strongest relationship found for CpG sites within FMR1
intron 1 (p < 5.6 × 10-5). Applying the WG method to the FXS cohort unmasked
significant epi-genotype-phenotype relationships. These results extend previous
evidence in blood to BEC and demonstrate FREE2 DNA methylation to be a sensitive 
epigenetic biomarker significantly associated with the variability in
intellectual functioning in FXS.

Effortful control, or the ability to suppress a dominant response to perform a
subdominant response, is an early-emerging temperament trait that is linked with 
positive social-emotional development. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene 
disorder characterized by hallmark regulatory impairments, suggesting diminished 
effortful control. This study compared the development of effortful control in
preschool boys with FXS ( n = 97) and typical development ( n = 32). Unlike their
typical peers, the boys with FXS did not exhibit growth in effortful control over
time, which could not be accounted for by adaptive impairments, FMR1 molecular
measures, or autism symptoms. These results contribute to our understanding of
the childhood phenotype of FXS that may be linked to the poor social-emotional
outcomes seen in this group.

Syndromic autism spectrum disorders: moving from a clinically defined to a
molecularly defined approach.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a group of neurodevelopmental
conditions diagnosed solely on the basis of behavioral assessments that reveal
social deficits. Progress has been made in understanding its genetic
underpinnings, but most ASD-associated genetic variants, which include copy
number variants (CNVs) and mutations in ASD-risk genes, account for no more than 
1 % of ASD cases. This high level of genetic heterogeneity leads to challenges
obtaining and interpreting genetic testing in clinical settings. The traditional 
definition of syndromic ASD is a disorder with a clinically defined pattern of
somatic abnormalities and a neurobehavioral phenotype that may include ASD. Most 
have a known genetic cause. Examples include fragile X syndrome and tuberous
sclerosis complex. We propose dividing syndromic autism into the following two
groups: (i) ASD that occurs in the context of a clinically defined
syndrome-recognizing these disorders depends on the familiarity of the clinician 
with the features of the syndrome, and the diagnosis is typically confirmed by
targeted genetic testing (eg, mutation screening of FMR1); (ii) ASD that occurs
as a feature of a molecularly defined syndrome-for this group of patients,
ASD-associated variants are identified by genome-wide testing that is not
hypothesis driven (eg, microarray, whole exome sequencing). These ASD groups
cannot be easily clinically defined because patients with a given variant have
variable somatic abnormalities (dysmorphism and birth defects). In this article, 
we review common diagnoses from the above categories and suggest a testing
strategy for patients, guided by determining whether the individual has essential
or complex ASD; patients in the latter group have multiple morphologic anomalies 
on physical examination. Finally, we recommend that the syndromic versus
nonsyndromic designation ultimately be replaced by classification of ASD
according to its genetic etiology, which will inform about the associated
spectrum and penetrance of neurobehavioral and somatic manifestations.

Publisher: El trastorno del espectro autista (TEA) incluye un grupo diverso de
cuadros del neurodesarrollo, diagnosticado por los clínicos únicamente en base a 
evaluaciones conductuales que revelan déficits sociales. Se ha progresado en la
comprensión de sus bases genéticas, pero la mayoría de las variantes genéticas
asociadas al TEA dan cuenta de no más del 1 % de los casos, y éstas incluyen
variabilidad del número de copias (VNC) y mutaciones en los genes de riesgo para 
el TEA. Este alto nivel de heterogeneidad genética genera un desafío en la
obtención e interpretación de las pruebas genéticas en los ambientes clínicos. La
definición tradicional de TEA sindromático se refiere a un trastorno con un
patrón clínicamente definido de alteraciones somáticas y un fenotipo
neuroconductual que incluye el TEA. La mayoría tiene una causa genéticamente
conocida y como ejemplos están el síndrome X frágil y el complejo esclerosis
tuberosa. Se propone dividir el autismo sindromático en dos grupos: 1) El TEA que
ocurre en el contexto de un síndrome definido clínicamente. El reconocimiento de 
estos trastornos depende de la familiaridad del clínico con las características
del síndrome, y el diagnóstico se confirma típicamente por pruebas genéticas
específicas (como la evaluación de FMR1) y 2) El TEA que ocurre como una
característica del síndrome definido molecularmente. Para este grupo de
pacientes, las variantes asociadas con el TEA se identifican mediante pruebas del
genoma completo, que no se basan en una hipótesis (como el estudio de microarray 
o la secuenciación completa de exoma). Estos grupos de TEA no pueden definirse
fácil clínicamente porque los pacientes con una variante determinada tienen
alteraciones somáticas variables (dimorfismos y defectos del nacimiento). En este
artículo se revisan los diagnósticos comunes a partir de las categorías
anteriores y se sugiere una estrategia de evaluación de los pacientes dependiendo
de si ellos tienen un TEA esencial o complejo; este último grupo tiene múltiples 
alteraciones morfológicas al examen físico. Por último, se recomienda que la
designación de sindromático versus no-sindromático sea reemplazada finalmente por
la clasificación de TEA de acuerdo con su etiología genética, la cual dará cuenta
del espectro asociado y de la penetrancia de las manifestaciones
neuroconductuales y somáticas.Publisher: Le trouble du spectre de l'autisme (TSA)
est un groupe de maladies neurodéveloppementales dont le diagnostic est établi
uniquement sur la base d'évaluations comportementales qui signent des déficits
sociaux. La compréhension des fondements génétiques du TSA progresse, mais la
plupart des variantes génétiques associées au TSA, comme la variabilité du nombre
de copies (VNC) et les mutations des gènes liés au TSA, ne représentent pas plus 
de 1 % des cas de TSA. Cette hétérogénéité génétique élevée rend difficiles la
réalisation et l'interprétation des dépistages génétiques en milieu clinique. La 
définition traditionnelle du TSA syndromique est un tableau clinique défini,
composé d'anomalies somatiques associées à un phénotype neurocomportemental
pouvant comprendre le TSA. La plupart ont une cause génétique connue, comme le
syndrome de l'X fragile et la sclérose tubéreuse complexe. Nous proposons de
diviser l'autisme syndromique en deux groupes : 1) le TSA survenant dans le
contexte d'un syndrome cliniquement défini - la reconnaissance de ces troubles
dépend de la connaissance du médecin des caractéristiques du syndrome, et le
diagnostic est confirmé généralement par des tests génétiques ciblés (par exemple
le dépistage d'une mutation du gène FMR1) ; 2) le TSA survenant en tant que
caractéristique d'un syndrome moléculairement défini - pour ce groupe de
patients, les variantes associées au TSA sont identifiées par un dépistage au
niveau du génome entier sans a priori (par exemple puces à ADN, séquençage de
l'exome entier). Ces groupes de TSA ne sont pas faciles à définir cliniquement
car les patients ayant une variante donnée ont des anomalies somatiques variables
(dysmorphisme et anomalies congénitales). Dans cet article, nous examinons les
diagnostics courants issus des catégories susmentionnées et suggérons une
stratégie de dépistage pour les patients, pour déterminer si leur TSA est
essentiel ou complexe, ce dernier groupe ayant des anomalies morphologiques
multiples à l'examen clinique. Enfin, nous recommandons que la classification
syndromique versus non syndromique soit finalement remplacée par une
classification du TSA selon son étiologie génétique, qui renseignera sur le
spectre et la pénétrance des manifestations neuro-comportementales et somatiques.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited
intellectual disabilities and autism. The reported prevalence of the full
mutation (FM) gene FMR1 in the general population is 0.2-0.4 per 1000 males and
0.125-0.4 per 1000 females. Population screening for FMR1 expanded alleles has
been performed in newborns and in an adult population. However, it has never been
carried out in an entire town. Ricaurte is a Colombian district with 1186
habitants, with a high prevalence of FXS, which was first described by
cytogenetic techniques in 1999.
METHODS: Using a PCR-based approach, screening for FXS was performed on blood
spot samples obtained from 926 (502 males and 424 females) inhabitants from
Ricaurte, accounting for 78% of total population.
RESULTS: A high prevalence of carriers of the expanded allele was observed in all
FXS mutation categories. Using the Bayesian methods the carrier frequency of FM
was 48.2 (95% Credibility Region CR: 36.3-61.5) per 1000 males and 20.5 (95%
CR:13.5-28.6) per 1000 females; the frequency of premutation carrier was 14.1
(95% RC: 8.0-21.7) per 1000 males (95% RC: 8.0-21.7 per 1000 males) and 35.9 (95%
RC: 26.5-46.2) per 1000 for females (95% RC: 26.5-46.2 per 1000 females), and
gray zone carrier was 13.4 (95% RC: 7.4-20.7) per 1000 males (95% RC: 7.4-20.7
per 1000 males) and 42.2 (95% RC: 32.2-53.8) per 1000 for females (95% RC:
32.2-53.8 per 1000 females). Differences in carrier frequencies were observed for
premutation and FM alleles between natives and non-natives.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in Ricaurte the carrier frequencies of FMR1
expanded alleles (premutations and FMs) are higher than those reported in the
literature, suggesting that Ricaurte constitutes a genetic cluster of FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability, is also highly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is
caused by expansion of a CGG repeat sequence on the X chromosome resulting in
silencing of the FMR1 gene. This is modeled in the mouse by deletion of Fmr1
(Fmr1 KO). Fmr1 KO mice recapitulate many of the behavioral features of the
disorder including seizure susceptibility, hyperactivity, impaired social
behavior, sleep problems, and learning and memory deficits. The mammalian target 
of rapamycin pathway (mTORC1) is upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and is thought to be
important for the pathogenesis of this disorder. We treated Fmr1 KO mice
chronically with an mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, to determine if rapamycin
treatment could reverse behavioral phenotypes. We performed open field, zero
maze, social behavior, sleep, passive avoidance, and audiogenic seizure testing. 
We found that pS6 was upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and normalized by rapamycin
treatment, but, except for an anxiogenic effect, it did not reverse any of the
behavioral phenotypes examined. In fact, rapamycin treatment had an adverse
effect on sleep and social behavior in both control and Fmr1 KO mice. These
results suggest that targeting the mTOR pathway in FXS is not a good treatment
strategy and that other pathways should be considered.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability, and is the leading known single-gene cause of autism spectrum
disorder. FXS patients display varied behavioural deficits that include mild to
severe cognitive impairments in addition to mood disorders. Currently there is no
cure for this condition, however minocycline is becoming commonly prescribed as a
treatment for FXS patients. Minocycline has been reported to alleviate social
behavioural deficits, and improve verbal functioning in patients with FXS;
however, its mode of action is not well understood. Previously we have shown that
FXS results in learning impairments that involve deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus
(DG). Here we tested whether chronic treatment with minocycline can improve these
deficits by enhancing NMDA receptor-dependent functional and structural
plasticity in the DG. Minocycline treatment resulted in a significant enhancement
in NMDA receptor function in the dentate granule cells. This was accompanied by
an increase in PSD-95 and GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in hippocampal
synaptoneurosome fractions. Minocycline treatment also enhanced dentate granule
cell dendritic length and branching. In addition, our results show that chronic
minocycline treatment can rescue performance in novel object recognition in FXS
mice. These findings indicate that minocycline treatment has both structural and 
functional benefits for hippocampal cells, which may partly contribute to the
pro-cognitive effects minocycline appears to have for treating FXS.

Silence of FMR1 causes loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and
dysregulated translation at synapses, resulting in the intellectual disability
and autistic symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS). Synaptic dysfunction
hypotheses for how intellectual disabilities like cognitive inflexibility arise
in FXS predict impaired neural coding in the absence of FMRP. We tested the
prediction by comparing hippocampus place cells in wild-type and FXS-model mice. 
Experience-driven CA1 synaptic function and synaptic plasticity changes are
excessive in Fmr1-null mice, but CA1 place fields are normal. However, Fmr1-null 
discharge relationships to local field potential oscillations are abnormally
weak, stereotyped, and homogeneous; also, discharge coordination within Fmr1-null
place cell networks is weaker and less reliable than wild-type. Rather than
disruption of single-cell neural codes, these findings point to invariant tuning 
of single-cell responses and inadequate discharge coordination within neural
ensembles as a pathophysiological basis of cognitive inflexibility in FXS. VIDEO

Altered neuronal network formation and function involving dysregulated excitatory
and inhibitory circuits are associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We examined
functional maturation of the excitatory transmission system in FXS by
investigating the response of FXS patient-derived neural progenitor cells to the 
glutamate analog (AMPA). Neural progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC) lines generated from boys with FXS had augmented intracellular Ca2+
responses to AMPA and kainate that were mediated by Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors
(CP-AMPARs) lacking the GluA2 subunit. Together with the enhanced differentiation
of glutamate-responsive cells, the proportion of CP-AMPAR and
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-coexpressing cells was increased in human
FXS progenitors. Differentiation of cells lacking GluA2 was also increased and
paralleled the increased inward rectification in neural progenitors derived from 
Fmr1-knockout mice (the FXS mouse model). Human FXS progenitors had increased the
expression of the precursor and mature forms of miR-181a, a microRNA that
represses translation of the transcript encoding GluA2. Blocking GluA2-lacking,
CP-AMPARs reduced the neurite length of human iPSC-derived control progenitors
and further reduced the shortened length of neurites in human FXS progenitors,
supporting the contribution of CP-AMPARs to the regulation of progenitor
differentiation. Furthermore, we observed reduced expression of Gria2 (the
GluA2-encoding gene) in the frontal lobe of FXS mice, consistent with functional 
changes of AMPARs in FXS. Increased Ca2+ influx through CP-AMPARs may increase
the vulnerability and affect the differentiation and migration of distinct cell
populations, which may interfere with normal circuit formation in FXS.

Fragile X-associated disorders encompass several conditions, which are caused by 
expansion mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Fragile X 
syndrome is the most common inherited etiology of intellectual disability and
results from a full mutation or >200 CGG repeats in FMR1. It is associated with
developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures. Fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs in 
premutation carriers of 55-200 CGG repeats in FMR1 and is characterized by
kinetic tremor, gait ataxia, parkinsonism, executive dysfunction, and neuropathy.
Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency also occurs in premutation
carrier women and manifests with infertility and early menopause. The diseases
constituting fragile X-associated disorders differ mechanistically, due to the
distinct molecular properties of premutation versus full mutations. Fragile X
syndrome occurs when there is a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP) due to FMR1 methylation and silencing. In fragile X-associated tremor
ataxia syndrome, a toxic gain of function is postulated with the production of
excess CGG repeat-containing FMR1 mRNA, abnormal translation of the repeat
sequence leading to production of polyglycine, polyalanine, and other
polypeptides and to outright deficits in translation leading to reduced FMRP at
larger premutation sizes. The changes in underlying brain chemistry due to FMR1
mutations have led to therapeutic studies in these disorders, with some progress 
being made in fragile X syndrome. This paper also summarizes indications for
testing, genetic counseling issues, and what the future holds for these
disorders.

AIMS: Several off-label studies have shown that acamprosate can provide some
clinical benefits in youth with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), an autism spectrum
disorder caused by loss of function of the highly conserved FMR1 gene. This study
investigated the ability of acamprosate to rescue cellular, molecular and
behavioral defects in the Drosophila model of FXS.
MAIN METHODS: A high (100μM) and low (10μM) dose of acamprosate was fed to
Drosophila FXS (dfmr1 null) or genetic control (w1118) larvae and then analyzed
in multiple paradigms. A larval crawling assay was used to monitor aberrant FXS
behavior, overgrowth of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) was quantified to assess
neuronal development, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate expression of 
deregulated cbp53E mRNA.
KEY FINDINGS: Acamprosate treatment partially or completely rescued all of the
FXS phenotypes analyzed, according to dose. High doses rescued cellular
overgrowth and dysregulated cbp53E mRNA expression, but aberrant crawling
behavior was not affected. Low doses of acamprosate, however, did not affect
synapse number at the NMJ, but could rescue NMJ overgrowth, locomotor defects,
and cbp53E mRNA expression. This dual nature of acamprosate suggests multiple
molecular mechanisms may be involved in acamprosate function depending on the
dosage used.
SIGNIFICANCE: Acamprosate may be a useful therapy for FXS and potentially other
autism spectrum disorders. However, understanding the molecular mechanisms
involved with different doses of this drug will likely be necessary to obtain
optimal results.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of inherited forms of mental
retardation and autism, is caused by the transcriptional silencing of fmr1
encoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding 
protein that is a widely expressed, but primarily in the brain and testis, and
associated approximately 4% of transcripts. Macro-orchidism is a common symptom
associated with FXS both in humans and mice. Thus, we analyze the pooled samples 
of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and testis from both the fmr1-KO and wild-type
mice by a LC-MS/MS proteomic study. Among the identified proteins, most of those 
showing significant changes in expression were up- or downregulated in the
absence of FMRP. Proteins (FMRP, RPS8, RPL23a and ATPIF1, RPL6, GAP43, MTCH2 and 
MPZ in brain, and FMRP, CAH3, AKR1B7 and C9 in testis) identified by MS/MS were
also verified by Western blotting. The Gene Ontology and WikiPathways analysis
revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were clustered in the
polyribosome and RNA-binding protein categories in both cerebral cortex and
hippocampus, but not in testis. Although this study was limited by the little
number of samples, our results provide detailed insights into the ribosomal
protein profiles of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and testis in the absence of
FMRP. Our studies also provide a better understanding of protein profile changes 
and the underlying dysregulated pathways arising from fmr1 silencing in FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of autism, is often
associated with hypersensitivity to sound. Several studies have shown
abnormalities in the auditory brainstem in FXS; however, the emergence of these
auditory phenotypes during development has not been described. Here, we
investigated the development of phenotypes in FXS model [Fmr1 knockout (KO)] mice
in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), medial nucleus of the trapezoid body
(MNTB), and lateral superior olive (LSO). We studied features of the brainstem
known to be altered in FXS or Fmr1 KO mice, including cell size and expression of
markers for excitatory (VGLUT) and inhibitory (VGAT) synapses. We found that cell
size was reduced in the nuclei with different time courses. VCN cell size is
normal until after hearing onset, while MNTB and LSO show decreases earlier. VGAT
expression was elevated relative to VGLUT in the Fmr1 KO mouse MNTB by P6, before
hearing onset. Because glial cells influence development and are altered in FXS, 
we investigated their emergence in the developing Fmr1 KO brainstem. The number
of microglia developed normally in all three nuclei in Fmr1 KO mice, but we found
elevated numbers of astrocytes in Fmr1 KO in VCN and LSO at P14. The results
indicate that some phenotypes are evident before spontaneous or auditory
activity, while others emerge later, and suggest that Fmr1 acts at multiple sites
and time points in auditory system development.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the major cause of inherited mental retardation and
the leading genetic cause of Autism spectrum disorders. FXS is caused by
mutations in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene, which results in
transcriptional silencing of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). To
elucidate cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of FXS, we compared
dendritic spines in the hippocampal CA1 region of adult wild-type (WT) and Fmr1
knockout (Fmr1-KO) mice. Using diolistic labeling, confocal microscopy, and
three-dimensional electron microscopy, we show a significant increase in the
diameter of secondary dendrites, an increase in dendritic spine density, and a
decrease in mature dendritic spines in adult Fmr1-KO mice. While WT and Fmr1-KO
mice had the same mean density of spines, the variance in spine density was three
times greater in Fmr1-KO mice. Reduced astrocyte participation in the tripartite 
synapse and less mature post-synaptic densities were also found in Fmr1-KO mice. 
We investigated whether the increase in synaptic spine density was associated
with altered synaptic pruning during development. Our data are consistent with
reduced microglia-mediated synaptic pruning in the CA1 region of Fmr1-KO
hippocampi when compared with WT littermates at postnatal day 21, which is the
peak period of synaptic pruning in the mouse hippocampus. Collectively, these
results support abnormal synaptogenesis and synaptic remodeling in mice deficient
in FMRP. Deficits in the maturation and distribution of synaptic spines on
dendrites of CA1 hippocampal neurons may play a role in the intellectual
disabilities associated with FXS.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) encoded by Fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) gene is a RNA-binding regulator of mRNA translation,
transport and stability with multiple targets responsible for proper synaptic
function. Epigenetic silencing of FMR1 gene expression leads to the development
of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) that is characterized by intellectual disability and 
other behavioral problems including autism. In the rat FXS model, the lack of
FMRP caused a deficit in hippocampal-dependent memory. However, the hippocampal
changes of FMRP in aging rats are not fully elucidated. The current study
addresses the changes in FMRP levels in dentate gyrus (DG) from young (17 weeks) 
and aging (22 months) Sprague - Dawley rats. The aging animal group showed
significant decline in spatial reference memory. Protein samples from five rats
per each group were analyzed by quantitative proteomic analysis resulting in 153 
significantly changed proteins. FMRP showed significant reduction in aging
animals which was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. 
Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of the differential protein dataset revealed 
several functionally related protein groups with individual interactions with
FMRP. These include high representation of the RNA translation and processing
machinery connected to FMRP and other RNA-binding regulators including CAPRIN1,
the members of Pumilio (PUM) and CUG-BP, Elav-like (CELF) family, and YTH
N(6)-methyladenosine RNA-binding proteins (YTHDF). The results of the current
study point to the important role of FMRP and regulation of RNA processing in the
rat DG and memory decline during the aging process.

Neurodevelopmental disorders such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) result in lifelong 
cognitive and behavioural deficits and represent a major public health burden.
FXS is the most frequent monogenic form of intellectual disability and autism,
and the underlying pathophysiology linked to its causal gene, FMR1, has been the 
focus of intense research. Key alterations in synaptic function thought to
underlie this neurodevelopmental disorder have been characterized and rescued in 
animal models of FXS using genetic and pharmacological approaches. These robust
preclinical findings have led to the implementation of the most comprehensive
drug development programme undertaken thus far for a genetically defined
neurodevelopmental disorder, including phase IIb trials of metabotropic glutamate
receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonists and a phase III trial of a GABAB receptor
agonist. However, none of the trials has been able to unambiguously demonstrate
efficacy, and they have also highlighted the extent of the knowledge gaps in drug
development for FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In this Review, we
examine potential issues in the previous studies and future directions for
preclinical and clinical trials. FXS is at the forefront of efforts to develop
drugs for neurodevelopmental disorders, and lessons learned in the process will
also be important for such disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic process in children ultimately diagnosed
with fragile X syndrome (FXS), with an emphasis on the time lag between initial
presentation and on diagnosis in female vs male children.
STUDY DESIGN: Interviews were conducted with 89 families of children with a final
diagnosis of FXS and assessment of time intervals between initial presentation
and confirmed molecular diagnosis.
RESULTS: Screening of 117 patients (25 female patients) from the 89 families
revealed that less than 20% of patients obtained a diagnosis within the first
year of seeking medical attention. Mean age at the time of initial presentation
was 12.3 months in male patients and 23 months in female patients, while
definitive diagnosis of FXS was made at a mean of 4 and 9 years, respectively.
Presenting symptoms of developmental delays were recognized by 72% of parents,
and 84% had another child with FXS before the index case diagnosis. Average age
of diagnosis for children with FXS born since 2007 was significantly lower at
31.9 months, compared with 69.5 months for children born before 2007.
CONCLUSIONS: Although FXS is a significant and prevalent cause of disability in
children, it is underdiagnosed and diagnosed late, especially in female patients.
In every male and female patient presenting with developmental delay or autism,
FXS should be considered. Dysmorphic physical features may not be present in
infancy, and the absence of those features cannot exclude a diagnosis of FXS.

NS-Pten knockout mice show sex- and age-specific differences in ultrasonic
vocalizations.

Author information:

Objective: The goal of this study was to identify changes in quantitative and
qualitative aspects of neonatal ultrasonic vocalizations USVs in neuron-subset
specific (NS-Pten) knockout males and females when compared with wild-type male
and female mice.
Background: One signaling cascade that plays a crucial role in the development of
an autistic-like phenotype is the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Mouse models that
illustrate this connection include Fmr1, Tsc1, and NS-Pten-deficient mice. While 
numerous studies have investigated ultrasonic vocalizations in Fmr1 knockout and 
Tsc1 heterogenous mice, none have investigated USVs in NS-Pten knockout mice
using a full spectrum recording system.
Methods: We recorded ultrasonic vocalizations from NS-Pten wild-type and knockout
male and female mice on postnatal days 8 and 11. On these days, we measured the
number and quality of calls emitted from pups when they were removed from their
mothers.
Results: We found that knockout pups emitted fewer vocalizations for both sexes
(p < .05). Knockout males had calls of a shorter duration and lower peak
amplitude on day 8, while showing a shorter duration, lower peak amplitude, and
higher peak and fundamental frequency on day 11 (p < .001). Knockout females
vocalized at a lower peak amplitude and fundamental frequency, and a higher peak 
frequency on day 8, while showing a shorter duration and a higher peak and
fundamental frequency on day 11 (p < .001). Spectrographic analyses also revealed
significant differences in call type for both genotypes and sexes (p < .05).
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that deletion of NS-Pten results in
significant decreases in vocalizations across both sexes. Additionally, our
findings indicate that the aberrant vocalizations and increased call duration
seen in other mTOR models are also present in NS-Pten knockout mice. Our study
provides evidence of a connection between hyperactive mTOR signaling and neonatal
ultrasonic vocalizations.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability, typically due to CGG-repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene leading to
lack of expression. We identified a rare FMR1 gene mutation (c.413G>A),
previously reported in a single patient and reviewed the literature for other
rare FMR1 mutations. Our patient at 10 years of age presented with the classical 
findings of FXS including intellectual disability, autism, craniofacial findings,
hyperextensibility, fleshy hands, flat feet, unsteady gait, and seizures but
without the typical CGG-repeat expansion. He had more features of FXS than the
previously reported patient with the same mutation. Twenty individuals reported
previously with rare missense or nonsense mutations or other coding disturbances 
of the FMR1 gene ranged in age from infancy to 50 years; most were verbal with
limited speech, had autism and hyperactivity, and all had intellectual
disability. Four of the 20 individuals had a mutation within exon 15, three
within exon 5, and two within exon 2. The FMR1 missense mutation (c.413G>A) is
the same as in a previously reported male where it was shown that there was
preservation of the post-synaptic function of the fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP), the encoded protein of the FMR1 gene was preserved. Both patients
with this missense mutation had physical, cognitive, and behavioral features
similarly seen in FXS.

The Search for an Effective Therapy to Treat Fragile X Syndrome: Dream or
Reality?

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of intellectual disability and a
primary cause of autism. It originates from the lack of the Fragile X Mental
Retardation Protein (FMRP), which is an RNA-binding protein encoded by the
Fragile X Mental Retardation Gene 1 (FMR1) gene. Multiple roles have been
attributed to this protein, ranging from RNA transport (from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, but also along neurites) to translational control of mRNAs. Over the
last 20 years many studies have found a large number of FMRP mRNA targets, but it
is still not clear which are those playing a critical role in the etiology of
FXS. So far, no therapy for FXS has been found, making the quest for novel
targets of considerable importance. Several pharmacological approaches have been 
attempted, but, despite some promising preclinical results, no strategy gave
successful outcomes, due either to the induction of major side effects or to the 
lack of improvement of the phenotypes. However, these studies suggested that, in 
order to measure the effectiveness of a specific treatment, trials should be
redesigned and new endpoints defined in FXS patients. Nevertheless, the search
for new therapeutic targets for FXS is very active. In this context, the advances
in animal modeling, coupled with better understanding of neurobiology and
physiopathology of FXS, are of crucial importance in developing new selected
treatments. Here, we discuss the pathways that were recently linked to the
physiopathology of FXS (mGluR, GABAR, insulin, Insulin-like Growth Factor 1
(IGF-1), MPP-9, serotonin, oxytocin and endocannabinoid signaling) and that
suggest new approaches to find an effective therapy for this disorder. Our goal
with this review article is to summarize some recent relevant findings on FXS
treatment strategies in order to have a clearer view of the different pathways
analyzed to date emphasizing those shared with other synaptic disorders.

Combination Therapy in Fragile X Syndrome; Possibilities and Pitfalls Illustrated
by Targeting the mGluR5 and GABA Pathway Simultaneously.

Netherlands.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenetic cause of intellectual
disability and autism. The disorder is characterized by altered synaptic
plasticity in the brain. Synaptic plasticity is tightly regulated by a complex
balance of different synaptic pathways. In FXS, various synaptic pathways are
disrupted, including the excitatory metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)
and the inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways. Targeting each of these
pathways individually, has demonstrated beneficial effects in animal models, but 
not in patients with FXS. This lack of translation might be due to
oversimplification of the disease mechanisms when targeting only one affected
pathway, in spite of the complexity of the many pathways implicated in FXS. In
this report we outline the hypothesis that targeting more than one pathway
simultaneously, a combination therapy, might improve treatment effects in FXS. In
addition, we present a glance of the first results of chronic combination therapy
on social behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. In contrast to what we expected, targeting
both the mGluR5 and the GABAergic pathways simultaneously did not result in a
synergistic effect, but in a slight worsening of the social behavior phenotype.
This does implicate that both pathways are interconnected and important for
social behavior. Our results underline the tremendous fine-tuning that is needed 
to reach the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the synapse in relation to social
behavior. We believe that alternative strategies focused on combination therapy

compartments or cell-types.

Episodic memory, a fundamental component of human cognition, is significantly
impaired in autism. We believe we report the first evidence for this problem in
the Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse model of Fragile X syndrome and describe potentially
treatable underlying causes. The hippocampus is critical for the formation and
use of episodes, with semantic (cue identity) information relayed to the
structure via the lateral perforant path (LPP). The unusual form of synaptic
plasticity expressed by the LPP (lppLTP) was profoundly impaired in Fmr1-KOs
relative to wild-type mice. Two factors contributed to this defect: (i) reduced
GluN1 subunit levels in synaptic NMDA receptors and related currents, and (ii)
impaired retrograde synaptic signaling by the endocannabinoid
2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Studies using a novel serial cue paradigm showed
that episodic encoding is dependent on both the LPP and the endocannabinoid
receptor CB1, and is strikingly impaired in Fmr1-KOs. Enhancing 2-AG signaling
rescued both lppLTP and learning in the mutants. Thus, two consequences of the
Fragile-X mutation converge on plasticity at one site in hippocampus to prevent
encoding of a basic element of cognitive memory. Collectively, the results
suggest a clinically plausible approach to treatment.

Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) patients display intellectual disability and autism
spectrum disorder due to silencing of the X-linked, fragile-X mental
retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. Dysregulation of cAMP metabolism is a consistent
finding in patients and in the mouse and fly FXS models. We therefore explored if
BPN14770, a prototypic phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator
(PDE4D-NAM) in early human clinical trials, might provide therapeutic benefit in 
the mouse FXS model. Daily treatment of adult male fmr1 C57Bl6 knock-out mice
with BPN14770 for 14 days reduced hyperarousal, improved social interaction, and 
improved natural behaviors such as nesting and marble burying as well as
dendritic spine morphology. There was no decrement in behavioral scores in
control C57Bl6 treated with BPN14770. The behavioral benefit of BPN14770
persisted two weeks after washout of the drug. Thus, BPN14770 may be useful for
the treatment of fragile-X syndrome and other disorders with decreased cAMP
signaling.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide
expansion in the gene FMR1 on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of
FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to
underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly
increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing
factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused
disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model
mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with
abnormal dendritic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a
constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex
of Fmr1-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and
increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a
small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a
causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued
synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V
pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings
suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic 
defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously
unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine
morphology and spine density associated with FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by silencing of the FMR1
gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding 
protein that represses the translation of its target mRNAs. One mechanism by
which FMRP represses translation is through its association with cytoplasmic
FMRP-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which subsequently sequesters and inhibits
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). CYFIP1 shuttles between the FMRP-eIF4E
complex and the Rac1-Wave regulatory complex, thereby connecting translational
regulation to actin dynamics and dendritic spine morphology, which are
dysregulated in FXS model mice that lack FMRP. Treating FXS mice with 4EGI-1,
which blocks interactions between eIF4E and eIF4G, a critical interaction partner
for translational initiation, reversed defects in hippocampus-dependent memory
and spine morphology. We also found that 4EGI-1 normalized the phenotypes of
enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated long-term depression
(LTD), enhanced Rac1-p21-activated kinase (PAK)-cofilin signaling, altered actin 
dynamics, and dysregulated CYFIP1/eIF4E and CYFIP1/Rac1 interactions in FXS mice.
Our findings are consistent with the idea that an imbalance in protein synthesis 
and actin dynamics contributes to pathophysiology in FXS mice, and suggest that
targeting eIF4E may be a strategy for treating FXS.

Functional imaging and gene expression studies both implicate the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), particularly deep-layer projection neurons, as a
potential locus for autism pathology. Here, we explored how specific deep-layer
prefrontal neurons contribute to abnormal physiology and behavior in mouse models
of autism. First, we find that across three etiologically distinct models-in
utero valproic acid (VPA) exposure, CNTNAP2 knockout and FMR1 knockout-layer 5
subcortically projecting (SC) neurons consistently exhibit reduced input
resistance and action potential firing. To explore how altered SC neuron
physiology might impact behavior, we took advantage of the fact that in deep
layers of the mPFC, dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) are mainly expressed by SC
neurons, and used D2-Cre mice to label D2R+ neurons for calcium imaging or
optogenetics. We found that social exploration preferentially recruits mPFC D2R+ 
cells, but that this recruitment is attenuated in VPA-exposed mice. Stimulating
mPFC D2R+ neurons disrupts normal social interaction. Conversely, inhibiting
these cells enhances social behavior in VPA-exposed mice. Importantly, this
effect was not reproduced by nonspecifically inhibiting mPFC neurons in
VPA-exposed mice, or by inhibiting D2R+ neurons in wild-type mice. These findings
suggest that multiple forms of autism may alter the physiology of specific
deep-layer prefrontal neurons that project to subcortical targets. Furthermore, a
highly overlapping population-prefrontal D2R+ neurons-plays an important role in 
both normal and abnormal social behavior, such that targeting these cells can
elicit potentially therapeutic effects.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most prevalent form of inherited intellectual
disability and the foremost monogenetic cause of autism, is caused by loss of
expression of the FMR1 gene . Here, we show that dfmr1 modulates the global
metabolome in Drosophila. Despite our previous discovery of increased brain
insulin signaling, our results indicate that dfmr1 mutants have reduced
carbohydrate and lipid stores and are hypersensitive to starvation stress. The
observed metabolic deficits cannot be explained by feeding behavior, as we report
that dfmr1 mutants are hyperphagic. Rather, our data identify dfmr1 as a
regulator of mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that under supersaturating
conditions, dfmr1 mutant mitochondria have significantly increased maximum
electron transport system (ETS) capacity. Moreover, electron micrographs of
indirect flight muscle reveal striking morphological changes in the dfmr1 mutant 
mitochondria. Taken together, our results illustrate the importance of dfmr1 for 
proper maintenance of nutrient homeostasis and mitochondrial function.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), also called Martin-Bell syndrome, is a non-Mendelian
trinucleotide repeat disorder. FXS is the most prevalent inherited cause of mild 
to severe intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD)[1][2]. It accounts for about one-half of cases of
X-linked mental retardation and is the most common cause of mental impairment
after trisomy 21 physical features include a long and narrow face with a
prominent jaw, flexible fingers, large ears, and enlarged testicles in males.
These features usually become more apparent in older children. About a third of
these children have features of autism and delayed speech that are present from
an early age. Hyperactivity and seizures are common. FXS is indirectly caused by 
expansion of the cysteine-guanine-guanine (CGG) triplet repeat within the Fragile
X mental retardation one gene (FMR1) located on the X chromosome [3]. This CGG
expansion silences FMR1 expression resulting in an abolished, or greatly
diminished, expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP
is needed for the development of neuronal connections (synapses) and some ovarian
functions. The lack of FMRP is the direct cause of FXS. Diagnosis is by molecular
genetic testing which determines the number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene.
Normally, it is between five and 40 repeats. Individuals with 55 to 200 repeats
have an FMR1 gene premutation (PM) and usually (but not always) have a normal
intellect. Individuals with greater than 200 CGG repeats have a full mutation
(FM) for FXS. Testing for PM carriers (by an FMR1 DNA test) allows for genetic
counseling. Prenatal testing for FXS is an option often provided to women with a 
premutation or a full mutation.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used a systemic Fmr1 knockout in order to
investigate both genotype- and sex-specific differences across multiple measures 
of sociability, repetitive behaviors, activity levels, anxiety, and fear-related 
learning and memory.
BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is the most common monogenic cause of intellectual
disability and autism. Few studies to date have examined sex differences in a
mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, though clinical data support the idea of
differences in both overall prevalence and phenotype between the sexes.
METHODS: Using wild-type and systemic homozygous Fmr1 knockout mice, we assessed 
a variety of behavioral paradigms in adult animals, including the open field
test, elevated plus maze, nose-poke assay, accelerating rotarod, social partition
task, three-chambered social task, and two different fear conditioning paradigms.
Tests were ordered such that the most invasive tests were performed last in the
sequence, and testing paradigms for similar behaviors were performed in separate 
cohorts to minimize testing effects.
RESULTS: Our results indicate several sex-specific changes in Fmr1 knockout mice,
including male-specific increases in activity levels, and female-specific
increases in repetitive behaviors on both the nose-poke assay and motor
coordination on the accelerating rotarod task. The results also indicated that
Fmr1 deletion results in deficits in fear learning and memory across both sexes, 
and no changes in social behavior across two tasks.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of including female subjects 
in preclinical studies, as simply studying the impact of genetic mutations in
males does not yield a complete picture of the phenotype. Further research should
explore these marked phenotypic differences among the sexes. Moreover, given that
treatment strategies are typically equivalent between the sexes, the results
highlight a potential need for sex-specific therapeutics.

Abnormal sensory responses associated with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism
spectrum disorders include hypersensitivity and impaired habituation to repeated 
stimuli. Similar sensory deficits are also observed in adult Fmr1 knock-out (KO) 
mice and are reversed by genetic deletion of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
through yet unknown mechanisms. Here we present new evidence that impaired
development of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons may underlie
hyper-responsiveness in auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice via MMP-9-dependent
regulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). First, we found that PV cell development 
and PNN formation around GABAergic interneurons were impaired in developing
auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Second, MMP-9 levels were elevated in P12-P18
auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and genetic reduction of MMP-9 to WT levels
restored the formation of PNNs around PV cells. Third, in vivo single-unit
recordings from auditory cortex neurons showed enhanced spontaneous and
sound-driven responses in developing Fmr1 KO mice, which were normalized
following genetic reduction of MMP-9. These findings indicate that elevated MMP-9
levels contribute to the development of sensory hypersensitivity by influencing
formation of PNNs around PV interneurons suggesting MMP-9 as a new therapeutic
target to reduce sensory deficits in FXS and potentially other autism spectrum
disorders.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is a leading cause
of inherited intellectual disability, and the most common known cause of autism
spectrum disorder. FXS is broadly characterized by sensory hypersensitivity and
several developmental alterations in synaptic and circuit function have been
uncovered in the sensory cortex of the mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO).
GABA-mediated neurotransmission and fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic interneurons are 
central to cortical circuit development in the neonate. Here we demonstrate that 
there is a delay in the maturation of the intrinsic properties of FS interneurons
in the sensory cortex, and a deficit in the formation of excitatory synaptic
inputs on to these neurons in neonatal Fmr1 KO mice. Both these delays in
neuronal and synaptic maturation were rectified by chronic administration of a
TrkB receptor agonist. These results demonstrate that the maturation of the
GABAergic circuit in the sensory cortex is altered during a critical
developmental period due in part to a perturbation in BDNF-TrkB signaling, and
could contribute to the alterations in cortical development underlying the
sensory pathophysiology of FXS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Fragile X (FXS) individuals
have a range of sensory related phenotypes, and there is growing evidence of
alterations in neuronal circuits in the sensory cortex of the mouse model of FXS 
(Fmr1 KO). GABAergic interneurons are central to the correct formation of
circuits during cortical critical periods. Here we demonstrate a delay in the
maturation of the properties and synaptic connectivity of interneurons in Fmr1 KO
mice during a critical period of cortical development. The delays both in
cellular and synaptic maturation were rectified by administration of a TrkB
receptor agonist, suggesting reduced BDNF-TrkB signaling as a contributing
factor. These results provide evidence that the function of fast-spiking
interneurons is disrupted due to a deficiency in neurotrophin signaling during
early development in FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability,
most commonly results from an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene to more than 200 copies (full
mutation). The FXS phenotype differs by sex and is associated with intellectual
and cognitive impairment, characteristic physical features, epilepsy, and/or
behavioral challenges including autism spectrum disorder. In this patient
population, tumors involving blood cells, digestive organs, the central nervous
system, and testes have been described, but melanocytic tumors have not been
reported. Here, we describe two maternal cousins with FXS, one of whom has
melanoma and the other has atypical nevus syndrome. We discuss possible
mechanisms leading to this unusual or possibly coincidental association and the
difficulties in the optimal treatment of FXS patients.

OBJECTIVE: The Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 (FMR1) premutation is a common
genetic abnormality, affecting ~1:150 women in the United States. Clinical
neuropsychologists are becoming increasingly aware of their role in the clinical 
management of the FMR1 premutation, which is associated with risk for a range of 
cognitive, executive, neuromotor, and psychological impairments, including
neurodegenerative disease. This study investigated atypical eye contact as a
critical neuropsychological phenotype associated with the FMR1 premutation.
METHODS: Thirty-eight women with the FMR1 premutation and 27 control women
engaged in a 20-min conversational sample with an examiner. Eye contact quality
was coded from the videotaped samples by blinded coders. Mixed models tested
group differences in eye contact during the beginning and the end of the
conversation. Social anxiety and broad autism phenotype (BAP) traits were tested 
as predictors of eye contact quality across the groups.
RESULTS: Women with the FMR1 premutation exhibited significantly reduced eye
contact during both the beginning and the end of the social interaction, despite 
a 'warm-up' effect where eye contact improved by the end of the interaction. Eye 
contact quality was not associated with social anxiety or BAP traits.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports reduced eye contact as a phenotypic feature of
the FMR1 premutation, which presents independent of social anxiety and the BAP.
These findings contribute to a growing understanding of the neuropsychological
phenotype of the FMR1 premutation, which has public health implications given
that >1 million individuals in the United States carry this genetic abnormality.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited form of intellectual disability
and autism spectrum disorder, and patients can present with severe behavioural
alterations, including hyperactivity, impulsivity and anxiety, in addition to
poor language development and seizures. FXS is a trinucleotide repeat disorder,
in which >200 repeats of the CGG motif in FMR1 leads to silencing of the gene and
the consequent loss of its product, fragile X mental retardation 1 protein
(FMRP). FMRP has a central role in gene expression and regulates the translation 
of potentially hundreds of mRNAs, many of which are involved in the development
and maintenance of neuronal synaptic connections. Indeed, disturbances in
neuroplasticity is a key finding in FXS animal models, and an imbalance in
inhibitory and excitatory neuronal circuits is believed to underlie many of the
clinical manifestations of this disorder. Our knowledge of the proteins that are 
regulated by FMRP is rapidly growing, and this has led to the identification of
multiple targets for therapeutic intervention, some of which have already moved
into clinical trials or clinical practice.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the FMR1
gene located on the X-chromosome, which leads to the most common cause of
inherited intellectual disability in males and the leading single-gene defect
associated with autism. A full mutation (FM) is represented by more than 200 CGG 
repeats within the FMR1 gene, resulting in FXS. A FM is inherited from women
carrying a FM or a premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG repeats) allele. PM is associated 
with phenotypes distinct from those associated with FM. Some manifestations of
the PM are unique; fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and
fragile-X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), while others tend to 
be non-specific such as intellectual disability. In addition, women carrying a PM
may suffer from subfertility or infertility. There is a need to elucidate whether
the impairment of ovarian function found in PM carriers arises during the
primordial germ cell (PGC) development stage, or due to a rapidly diminishing
oocyte pool throughout life or even both. Due to the possibility of expansion
into a FM in the next generation, and other ramifications, carrying a PM can have
an enormous impact on one's life; therefore, preconception counseling for couples
carrying the PM is of paramount importance. In this review, we will elaborate on 
the clinical manifestations in female PM carriers and propose the definition of
fragile-X-associated diminished ovarian reserve (FXDOR), then we will review
recent scientific findings regarding possible mechanisms leading to FXDOR and
FXPOI. Lastly, we will discuss counseling, preventative measures and
interventions available for women carrying a PM regarding different aspects of
their reproductive life, fertility treatment, pregnancy, prenatal testing,
contraception and fertility preservation options.

BACKGROUND: Size and methylation mosaicism are a common phenomenon in Fragile X
syndrome (FXS). Here, the authors report a study on twelve fragile X males with
atypical mosaicism, seven of whom presented with autism spectrum disorder.
METHODS: A combination of Southern Blot and PCR analysis was used for CGG allele 
sizing and methylation. FMR1 mRNA and FMRP expression were measured by qRT-PCR
and by Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence methodology, respectively.
RESULTS: DNA analysis showed atypical size- or methylation-mosaicism with both,
full mutation and smaller (normal to premutation) alleles, as well as a
combination of methylated and unmethylated alleles. Four individuals carried a
deletion of the CGG repeat and portions of the flanking regions. The extent of
methylation among the participants was reflected in the lower FMR1 mRNA and FMRP 
expression levels detected in these subjects.
CONCLUSION: Decreased gene expression is likely the main contributor to the
cognitive impairment observed in these subjects; although the presence of a
normal allele did not appear to compensate for the presence of the full mutation,
it correlated with better cognitive function in some but not all of the reported 
cases emphasizing the complexity of the molecular and clinical profile in FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), due to mutations of the FMR1 gene, is the most common
known inherited cause of developmental disability. The cognitive, behavioral, and
neurological phenotypes observed in affected individuals can vary considerably,
making it difficult to predict outcomes and determine the need for interventions.
We sought to examine early structural brain growth as a potential marker for
identification of clinically meaningful subgroups. Participants included 42 very 
young boys with FXS who completed a T1-weighted anatomical MRI and
cognitive/behavioral assessment at two longitudinal time points, with mean ages
of 2.89 y and 4.91 y. Topological data analysis (TDA), an unsupervised approach
to multivariate pattern analysis, was applied to the longitudinal anatomical data
to identify coherent but heretofore unknown subgroups. TDA revealed two large
subgroups within the study population based solely on longitudinal MRI data. Post
hoc comparisons of cognition, adaptive functioning, and autism severity scores
between these groups demonstrated that one group was consistently higher
functioning on all measures at both time points, with pronounced and significant 
unidirectional differences (P < 0.05 for time point 1 and/or time point 2 for
each measure). These results support the existence of two longitudinally defined,
neuroanatomically distinct, and clinically relevant phenotypes among boys with
FXS. If confirmed by additional analyses, such information may be used to predict
outcomes and guide design of targeted therapies. Furthermore, TDA of longitudinal
anatomical MRI data may represent a useful method for reliably and objectively
defining subtypes within other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Adult Fmr1 knockout mice present with deficiencies in hippocampal interleukin-6
and tumor necrosis factor-α expression.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a single
genetic mutation in the FMR1 gene. Mutations in the FMR1 gene are the largest
monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and thus both disorders share 
many of the same cognitive and behavioral impairments. There is increasing
evidence suggesting that dysregulated immune responses play a role in the
pathophysiology of ASD; however, the association between FXS and altered immunity
requires further investigation. This study examined whether Fmr1 knockout (KO)
and wild-type mice on a FVB/NJ background strain had altered cytokine expression 
at baseline levels in the hippocampus. Results showed Fmr1 KO mice to have
decreased proinflammatory cytokine hippocampal mRNA expression, specifically
interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, compared with wild-type mice.
However, no differences were detected in the expression levels of IL-1β, MCP-1,
interferon-γ, or IL-10. Despite the high comorbidity between FXS and ASD, these
results suggest that the Fmr1 KO mouse does not mimic the increased
proinflammatory cytokine expression commonly found in ASD mouse models and
patients. Further investigation of the immune profile of the Fmr1 KO mouse is
critical to understand whether this deficiency of cytokines in the hippocampus is
indicative of a broader immunologic deficit associated with FXS.

Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Restricts Small Dye Iontophoresis Entry into
Central Neurons.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) loss causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS),
a major disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, hyperactivity,
and seizures. FMRP is both an RNA- and channel-binding regulator, with critical
roles in neural circuit formation and function. However, it remains unclear how
these FMRP activities relate to each other and how dysfunction in their absence
underlies FXS neurological symptoms. In testing circuit level defects in the
Drosophila FXS model, we discovered a completely unexpected and highly robust
neuronal dye iontophoresis phenotype in the well mapped giant fiber (GF) circuit.
Controlled dye injection into the GF interneuron results in a dramatic increase
in dye uptake in neurons lacking FMRP. Transgenic wild-type FMRP reintroduction
rescues the mutant defect, demonstrating a specific FMRP requirement. This
phenotype affects only small dyes, but is independent of dye charge polarity.
Surprisingly, the elevated dye iontophoresis persists in shaking B mutants that
eliminate gap junctions and dye coupling among GF circuit neurons. We therefore
used a wide range of manipulations to investigate the dye uptake defect,
including timed injection series, pharmacology and ion replacement, and
optogenetic activity studies. The results show that FMRP strongly limits the rate
of dye entry via a cytosolic mechanism. This study reveals an unexpected new
phenotype in a physical property of central neurons lacking FMRP that could
underlie aspects of FXS disruption of neural function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT FXS 
is a leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum
disorders. Although researchers established the causal link with FMRP loss >;25
years ago, studies continue to reveal diverse FMRP functions. The Drosophila FXS 
model is key to discovering new FMRP roles, because of its genetic malleability
and individually identified neuron maps. Taking advantage of a well characterized
Drosophila neural circuit, we discovered that neurons lacking FMRP take up
dramatically more current-injected small dye. After examining many neuronal
properties, we determined that this dye defect is cytoplasmic and occurs due to a
highly elevated dye iontophoresis rate. We also report several new factors
affecting neuron dye uptake. Understanding how FMRP regulates iontophoresis
should reveal new molecular factors underpinning FXS dysfunction.

RNA modifications are integral to the regulation of RNA metabolism. One abundant 
mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which affects various aspects of
RNA metabolism, including splicing, translation and degradation. Current
knowledge about the proteins recruited to m6A to carry out these molecular
processes is still limited. Here we describe comprehensive and systematic
mass-spectrometry-based screening of m6A interactors in various cell types and
sequence contexts. Among the main findings, we identified G3BP1 as a protein that
is repelled by m6A and positively regulates mRNA stability in an m6A-regulated
manner. Furthermore, we identified FMR1 as a sequence-context-dependent m6A
reader, thus revealing a connection between an mRNA modification and an autism
spectrum disorder. Collectively, our data represent a rich resource and shed
further light on the complex interplay among m6A, m6A interactors and mRNA
homeostasis.

The fragile X-related disorders are a group of three clinical conditions
resulting from the instability of a CGG-repeat tract at the 5' end of the FMR1
transcript. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile
X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) are disorders seen in carriers
of FMR1 alleles with 55-200 repeats. Female carriers of these premutation (PM)
alleles are also at risk of having a child who has an FMR1 allele with >200
repeats. Most of these full mutation (FM) alleles are epigenetically silenced
resulting in a deficit of the FMR1 gene product, FMRP. This results in fragile X 
Syndrome (FXS), the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and
autism. The diagnosis and study of these disorders is challenging, in part
because the detection of alleles with large repeat numbers has, until recently,
been either time-consuming or unreliable. This problem is compounded by the
mosaicism for repeat length and/or DNA methylation that is frequently seen in PM 
and FM carriers. Furthermore, since AGG interruptions in the repeat tract affect 
the risk that a FM allele will be maternally transmitted, the ability to
accurately detect these interruptions in female PM carriers is an additional
challenge that must be met. This review will discuss some of the pros and cons of
some recently described assays for these disorders, including those that detect
FMRP levels directly, as well as emerging technologies that promise to improve
the diagnosis of these conditions and to be useful in both basic and
translational research settings.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a generally hereditary form of human mental
retardation that is caused by triplet repeat expansion (CGG) mutation in fragile 
X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene promoter and that results in the absence of
the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. The common symptoms
of FXS patients include learning disabilities, anxiety, autistic behaviors, as
well as other behavioral abnormalities. Our previous results demonstrated the
behavioral abnormalities in fmr1 knockout (KO) zebrafish such as fear memory
impairment and autism-like behavior. Here, we studied the functional role of fmr1
gene on the development of social behavior by behavioral experiments, including
shoaling behavior, shoaling preference, light/dark test, and novel tank task. Our
results demonstrated that precocious development of shoaling behavior is found in
fmr1 KO zebrafish without affecting the shoaling preference on conspecific
zebrafish. The shoaling behavior appeared after 14 days postfertilization (dpf), 
and the level of shoaling elevated in fmr1 KO zebrafish. Furthermore, the fmr1 KO
zebrafish at 28 dpf expressed higher anxiety level in novel tank task. These
results suggest that the change of shoaling behavior in fmr1 KO zebrafish may
result from hyperactivity and an increase of anxiety.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a heritable intellectual and autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), results from the loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). This
neurodevelopmental disease state exhibits neural circuit hyperconnectivity and
hyperexcitability. Canonically, FMRP functions as an mRNA-binding translation
suppressor, but recent findings have enormously expanded its proposed roles.
Although connections between burgeoning FMRP functions remain unknown, recent
advances have extended understanding of its involvement in RNA, channel, and
protein binding that modulate calcium signaling, activity-dependent critical
period development, and the excitation-inhibition (E/I) neural circuitry balance.
In this review, we contextualize 3 years of FXS model research. Future directions
extrapolated from recent advances focus on discovering links between FMRP roles
to determine whether FMRP has a multitude of unrelated functions or whether
combinatorial mechanisms can explain its multifaceted existence.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability
and autism. FXS results from the loss of function of fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP), which represses translation of target transcripts. Most of the
well-characterized target transcripts of FMRP are synaptic proteins, yet
targeting these proteins has not provided effective treatments. We examined a
group of FMRP targets that encode transcriptional regulators, particularly
chromatin-associated proteins. Loss of FMRP in mice results in widespread changes
in chromatin regulation and aberrant gene expression. To determine if targeting
epigenetic factors could reverse phenotypes associated with the disorder, we
focused on Brd4, a BET protein and chromatin reader targeted by FMRP. Inhibition 
of Brd4 function alleviated many of the phenotypes associated with FXS. We
conclude that loss of FMRP results in significant epigenetic misregulation and
that targeting transcription via epigenetic regulators like Brd4 may provide new 
treatments for FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability (ID) and autism. In most of cases, the molecular basis of this
syndrome is a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1
gene. It is inherited as an X linked dominant trait, with a reduced penetrance
(80% for males and 30% for females). Full mutation (FM) expansion from premutated
alleles (PM) is only acquired via maternal meiosis, while paternal transmission
always remains in the PM range. We present a 16-year-old girl with a mild fragile
X syndrome phenotype. FMR1 gene study showed that the patient inherited a mosaic 
premutation-full mutation with an unmethylated uninterrupted allele (175, >200
CGG) from her father. The father showed an 88 CGG uninterrupted unmethylated
allele in blood and sperm cells. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a
FMR1 mosaic premutation-full mutation allele inherited from a PM father. In our
opinion, the most likely explanation could be a postzygotic somatic expansion. We
can conclude that in rare cases of a child with a full mutation whose mother does
not carry a premutation, the possibility of paternal transmission should be
considered.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Given the nature of FMR1 gene expansions, most
biological mothers, and often multiple other family members of children with
fragile X syndrome (FXS), will have a premutation, which may increase individual 
and family vulnerabilities. This article summarizes important gaps in knowledge
and notes potential implications for pediatric providers with regard to
developmental and medical risks for children and adolescents with an FMR1
premutation, including possible implications into adulthood.
METHODS: A structured electronic literature search was conducted on FMR1 pre- and
full mutations, yielding a total of 306 articles examined. Of these, 116 focused 
primarily on the premutation and are included in this review.
RESULTS: Based on the literature review, 5 topic areas are discussed: genetics
and epidemiology; phenotypic characteristics of individuals with the premutation;
implications for carrier parents of children with FXS; implications for the
extended family; and implications for pediatricians.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the premutation phenotype is typically less severe in
clinical presentation than in FXS, premutation carriers are much more common and 
are therefore more likely to be seen in a typical pediatric practice. In
addition, there is a wide range of medical, cognitive/developmental, and
psychiatric associated features that individuals with a premutation are at
increased risk for having, which underscores the importance of awareness on the
part of pediatricians in identifying and monitoring premutation carriers and
recognizing the impact this identification may have on family members.

Excessive mRNA translation downstream of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGlu1/5) is a core pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome (FX); however, the
differentially translating mRNAs that contribute to altered neural function are
not known. We used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq 
to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the FX mouse model
(Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated mGlu1/5-induced long-term
synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find that the Chrm4 transcript
encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is excessively translated, and 
synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is mimicked and occluded.
Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 activity normalizes core
phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein synthesis, exaggerated
mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that not all
excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, and some may
be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in the FX brain.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common single gene cause for Autism Spectrum
Disorder and the most prevalent form of inherited mental retardation. Our prior
studies have demonstrated that adult FXS mice have abnormal blood vessel density 
(BVD) and elevated Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A expression (VEGF-A).
VEGF-A is one of the most prominent regulators of BVD, and its abnormal
expression is the most likely cause for FXS BVD abnormalities. We have
demonstrated that attenuating elevated VEGF-A expression can ameliorate many
non-vascular FXS abnormalities (Belagodu, Zendeli Slater and Galvez: Dev
Neurobiol 77 (2017) 14-25), suggesting that abnormal VEGF-A expression is an
underlying cause for some FXS abnormalities. However, FXS is a developmental
disorder and VEGF-A's potential role in mediating FXS abnormalities during
development have never been explored. Furthermore, VEGF-A is one protein in a
family of proteins (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, & PLGF) that activate one of 
three primary receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, & VEGFR3). Abnormal expression of any of
these proteins could hinder proper development. The current study demonstrated
that FXS mice do not exhibit normal BVD developmental patterns, resulting in
elevated adult expression, most likely due to observed elevated VEGF-A adult
expression. Interestingly, all five VEGF family of proteins exhibited altered
developmental expression patterns that could cause abnormal development. However,
none of the receptors exhibited abnormal adult expression, but did exhibit
altered developmental expression. Expanding upon our prior analyses, the current 
study provides additional interesting insight towards potential developmental
mechanisms mediating FXS abnormalities, while offering further sites for age
specific therapeutic interventions. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop

Lanka. chmbhagya@gmail.com

Introduction: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetically determined developmental 
disorder. Underlying genotype is cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat expansions
with over 200 repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Children
with FXS are most accessible in special education institutions in Sri Lanka, with
a total of approximately 6000 registered attendees.
Objectives: The aim of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of FXS
among special school attendees and to screen first degree relatives of affected
children.
Methods: A nationally representative sample of 850 children (5-18 years) was
selected using multi-level stratified sampling. Screening was performed by 3’
direct triplet primed PCR, followed by melting curve analysis. Expanded repeat
status of the screened positives were confirmed using capillary electrophoresis, 
methylation specific PCR and Southern hybridization. Screening of available first
degree relatives (n=12) were carried out using the same method of screening and
diagnosis.
Results: Eleven had FXS. Prevalence of FXS was 1.3% (95% CI 0.9-1.6). Among the
11 with FXS 9 had more than 350 CGG repeats, while the rest had around 300.
Twelve first degree relatives consisting of nine mothers, two female siblings and
a male sibling were tested. All mothers and female siblings had either full
mutation or premutation while the male sibling had CGG repeats in the normal
range.
Conclusions: Among the special school attendees, prevalence of FXS was 1.3% which
has a high risk for autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Behavioral intervention therapy has proven beneficial in the treatment of autism 
and intellectual disabilities (ID), raising the possibility of certain changes in
molecular mechanisms activated by these interventions that may promote learning. 
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
autistic features and intellectual disability and can serve as a model to examine
mechanisms that promote learning. FXS results from mutations in the fragile X
mental retardation 1 gene (Fmr1) that prevents expression of the Fmr1 protein
(FMRP), a messenger RNA (mRNA) translation regulator at synapses. Among many
other functions, FMRP organizes a complex with the actin cytoskeleton-regulating 
small Rho GTPase Rac1. As in humans, Fmr1 KO mice lacking FMRP display
autistic-like behaviors and deformities of actin-rich synaptic structures in
addition to impaired hippocampal learning and synaptic plasticity. These features
have been previously linked to proper function of actin remodeling proteins that 
includes Rac1. An important step in Rac1 activation and function is its
translocation to the membrane, where it can influence synaptic actin cytoskeleton
remodeling during hippocampus-dependent learning. Herein, we report that Fmr1 KO 
mouse hippocampus exhibits increased levels of membrane-bound Rac1, which may
prevent proper learning-induced synaptic changes. We also determine that
increasing training intensity during fear conditioning (FC) training restores
contextual memory in Fmr1 KO mice and reduces membrane-bound Rac1 in Fmr1 KO
hippocampus. Increased training intensity also results in normalized long-term
potentiation in hippocampal slices taken from Fmr1 KO mice. These results point
to interventional treatments providing new therapeutic options for FXS-related
cognitive dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Disagreements over genetic signatures associated with disease have
been particularly prominent in the field of psychiatric genetics, creating a
sharp divide between disease burdens attributed to common and rare variation,
with study designs independently targeting each. Meta-analysis within each of
these study designs is routine, whether using raw data or summary statistics, but
combining results across study designs is atypical. However, tests of functional 
convergence are used across all study designs, where candidate gene sets are
assessed for overlaps with previously known properties. This suggests one
possible avenue for combining not study data, but the functional conclusions that
they reach.
METHOD: In this work, we test for functional convergence in autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) across different study types, and specifically whether the degree 
to which a gene is implicated in autism is correlated with the degree to which it
drives functional convergence. Because different study designs are
distinguishable by their differences in effect size, this also provides a unified
means of incorporating the impact of study design into the analysis of
convergence.
RESULTS: We detected remarkably significant positive trends in aggregate
(p < 2.2e-16) with 14 individually significant properties (false discovery rate
<0.01), many in areas researchers have targeted based on different reasoning,
such as the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) interactor enrichment
(false discovery rate 0.003). We are also able to detect novel technical effects 
and we see that network enrichment from protein-protein interaction data is
heavily confounded with study design, arising readily in control data.
CONCLUSIONS: We see a convergent functional signal for a subset of known and
novel functions in ASD from all sources of genetic variation. Meta-analytic
approaches explicitly accounting for different study designs can be adapted to
other diseases to discover novel functional associations and increase statistical
power.

Hypersensitivity to sounds is one of the prevalent symptoms in individuals with
Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It manifests behaviorally early during development and 
is often used as a landmark for treatment efficacy. However, the physiological
mechanisms and circuit-level alterations underlying this aberrant behavior remain
poorly understood. Using the mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO), we demonstrate that
functional maturation of auditory brainstem synapses is impaired in FXS. Fmr1 KO 
mice showed a greatly enhanced excitatory synaptic input strength in neurons of
the lateral superior olive (LSO), a prominent auditory brainstem nucleus, which
integrates ipsilateral excitation and contralateral inhibition to compute
interaural level differences. Conversely, the glycinergic, inhibitory input
properties remained unaffected. The enhanced excitation was the result of an
increased number of cochlear nucleus fibers converging onto one LSO neuron,
without changing individual synapse properties. Concomitantly, immunolabeling of 
excitatory ending markers revealed an increase in the immunolabeled area,
supporting abnormally elevated excitatory input numbers. Intrinsic firing
properties were only slightly enhanced. In line with the disturbed development of
LSO circuitry, auditory processing was also affected in adult Fmr1 KO mice as
shown with single-unit recordings of LSO neurons. These processing deficits
manifested as an increase in firing rate, a broadening of the frequency response 
area, and a shift in the interaural level difference function of LSO neurons. Our
results suggest that this aberrant synaptic development of auditory brainstem
circuits might be a major underlying cause of the auditory processing deficits in
FXS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common
inheritable form of intellectual impairment, including autism. A core symptom of 
FXS is extreme sensitivity to loud sounds. This is one reason why individuals
with FXS tend to avoid social interactions, contributing to their isolation.
Here, a mouse model of FXS was used to investigate the auditory brainstem where
basic sound information is first processed. Loss of the Fragile X mental
retardation protein leads to excessive excitatory compared with inhibitory inputs
in neurons extracting information about sound levels. Functionally, this elevated
excitation results in increased firing rates, and abnormal coding of frequency
and binaural sound localization cues. Imbalanced early-stage sound level
processing could partially explain the auditory processing deficits in FXS.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability and the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
Despite a large number of therapeutics developed in past years, there is
currently no targeted treatment approved for FXS. In fact, translation of the
positive and very promising preclinical findings from animal models to human
subjects has so far fallen short owing in part to the low predictive validity of 
the Fmr1 ko mouse, an overly simplistic model of the complex human disease. This 
issue stresses the critical need to identify new surrogate human peripheral cell 
models of FXS, which may in fact allow for the identification of novel and more
efficient therapies. Of all described models, blood platelets appear to be one of
the most promising and appropriate disease models of FXS, in part owing to their 
close biochemical similarities with neurons. Noteworthy, they also recapitulate
some of FXS neuron's core molecular dysregulations, such as hyperactivity of the 
MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, elevated enzymatic activity of MMP9 and
decreased production of cAMP. Platelets might therefore help furthering our
understanding of FXS pathophysiology and might also lead to the identification of
disease-specific biomarkers, as was shown in several psychiatric disorders such
as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, there is additional evidence 
suggesting that platelet signaling may assist with prediction of cognitive
phenotype and could represent a potent readout of drug efficacy in clinical
trials. Globally, given the neurobiological overlap between different forms of
intellectual disability, platelets may be a valuable window to access the
molecular underpinnings of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD)
sharing similar synaptic plasticity defects with FXS. Platelets are indeed an
attractive model for unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms involved in NDD as 
well as to search for diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.

Fragile X Syndrome (FX) is generally considered a developmental disorder, arising
from a mutation that disrupts the transcription of Fragile X Mental Retardation
Protein (FMRP). However, FMRP regulates the transcription of other proteins and
participates in an unknown number of protein-protein interactions throughout
life. In addition to known developmental issues, it is thus likely that some
dysfunction is also due to the ongoing absence of FMRP. Dissociating dysfunction 
due to developmental dysregulation from dysfunction due to the continued absence 
of FMRP is necessary to understand the different roles of FMRP and to treat
patients effectively throughout life. We show here that FX model mice display
substantial deficits in a PFC-dependent task. We then use conditional knock-out
mice to eliminate FMRP only in the PFC alone of adult mice. We observe an
increase in the proportion of nonlearners and a delay in the onset of learning in
both FX and conditional knock-out mice. The results suggest that these deficits
(1) are due to the absence of FMRP in the PFC alone and (2) are not the result of
developmental dysregulation. Furthermore, PFC-associated deficits are rescued by 
initiating production of FMRP in adult conditional restoration mice, suggesting
that PFC dysfunction may persist as long as FMRP is absent and therefore can be
rescued after development. The data suggest that it is possible to dissociate the
roles of FMRP in neural function from developmental dysregulation, and that PFC
function can be restored in the adult FX brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The absence
of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) from birth results in
developmental disabilities and lifelong impairments. We show here that in mouse
models PFC dysfunction in Fragile X Syndrome (FX) can be attributed to the
continued absence of FMRP from the PFC, independent of FMRP status during
development. Furthermore, initiation of FMRP production in the PFC of adult FX
animals rescues PFC function. The results suggest that at least some FX-specific 
neurological defects can be rescued in the adult FX brain after development.

BACKGROUND: People with fragile X syndrome (FXS) often have deficits in social
behavior, and a substantial portion meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder.
Though the genetic cause of FXS is known to be due to the silencing of FMR1, and 
the Fmr1 null mouse model representing this lesion has been extensively studied, 
the contributions of this gene and its protein product, FMRP, to social behavior 
are not well understood.
METHODS: Fmr1 null mice and wildtype littermates were exposed to a social or
non-social stimulus. In one experiment, subjects were assessed for expression of 
the inducible transcription factor c-Fos in response to the stimulus, to detect
brain regions with social-specific activity. In a separate experiment, tissue was
taken from those brain regions showing differential activity, and RNA sequencing 
was performed.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed a significantly greater number of
c-Fos-positive cells in the lateral amygdala and medial amygdala in the brains of
mice exposed to a social stimulus, compared to a non-social stimulus. In the
prelimbic cortex, there was no significant effect of social stimulus; although
the number of c-Fos-positive cells was lower in the social condition compared to 
the non-social condition, and negatively correlated with c-Fos in the amygdala.
RNA sequencing revealed differentially expressed genes enriched for molecules
known to interact with FMRP and also for autism-related genes identified in the
Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative gene database. Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis detected enrichment of differentially expressed genes in networks and
pathways related to neuronal development, intracellular signaling, and
inflammatory response.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the Fmr1 null mouse model of fragile X syndrome, we have
identified brain regions, gene networks, and molecular pathways responsive to a
social stimulus. These findings, and future experiments following up on the role 
of specific gene networks, may shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying
dysregulated social behaviors in fragile X syndrome and more broadly.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic form of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). FXS with ASD results from the loss of fragile X mental
retardation (fmr) gene products, including fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP), which triggers a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities.
This disorder is also correlated with clock components underlying behavioral
circadian rhythms and, thus, a mutation of the fmr gene can result in disturbed
sleep patterns and altered circadian rhythms. As a result, FXS with ASD
individuals may experience dysregulation of melatonin synthesis and alterations
in melatonin-dependent signaling pathways that can impair vigilance, learning,
and memory abilities, and may be linked to autistic behaviors such as abnormal
anxiety responses. Although a wide variety of possible causes, symptoms, and
clinical features of ASD have been studied, the correlation between altered
circadian rhythms and FXS with ASD has yet to be extensively investigated. Recent
studies have highlighted the impact of melatonin on the nervous, immune, and
metabolic systems and, even though the utilization of melatonin for sleep
dysfunctions in ASD has been considered in clinical research, future studies
should investigate its neuroprotective role during the developmental period in
individuals with ASD. Thus, the present review focuses on the regulatory circuits
involved in the dysregulation of melatonin and disruptions in the circadian
system in individuals with FXS with ASD. Additionally, the neuroprotective
effects of melatonin intervention therapies, including improvements in

mechanisms underlying this disorder are reviewed. The authors suggest that
melatonin may be a useful treatment for FXS with ASD in terms of alleviating the 
adverse effects of variations in the circadian rhythm.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual
disability and the leading form of the monogenic cause of autism. Fragile X
mental retardation type 1 (FMR1) gene premutation is the first single-gene cause 
of primary ovarian failure (Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency
[FXPOI]) and one of the most common causes of ataxia (fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]), multiple additional phenotypes such as
fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, migraine headaches, sleep disturbances, sleep
apnea, restless legs syndrome, central pain syndrome, neuropathy and
neuropsychiatric alterations has been described. Clinical involvement in men and 
women carrying the FMR1 premutation currently constitutes a real health problem
in the society that should be taken into account. It is important to highlight
that while in FXS there is a loss-of-function of the FMR1 gene, in premutation
associated disorders there is a gain of FMR1 mRNA function. To date, the
tremendous progress achieved in the understanding of the pathophysiology of FXS, 
has led to the development of several targeted therapies aimed at preventing or
improving the neurological manifestations of the disease. This review is an
update of the diseases associated with the FMR1 gene.

BACKGROUND: Arbaclofen improved multiple abnormal phenotypes in animal models of 
fragile X syndrome (FXS) and showed promising results in a phase 2 clinical
study. The objective of the study is to determine safety and efficacy of
arbaclofen for social avoidance in FXS.
METHODS: Two phase 3 placebo-controlled trials were conducted, a flexible dose
trial in subjects age 12-50 (209FX301, adolescent/adult study) and a fixed dose
trial in subjects age 5-11 (209FX302, child study). The primary endpoint for both
trials was the Social Avoidance subscale of the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist-Community Edition, FXS-specific (ABC-CFX). Secondary outcomes included 
other ABC-CFX subscale scores, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I),
Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior
Scales, Second Edition (Vineland-II) Socialization domain score.
RESULTS: A total 119 of 125 randomized subjects completed the adolescent/adult
study (n = 57 arbaclofen, 62 placebo) and 159/172 completed the child study
(arbaclofen 5 BID n = 38; 10 BID n = 39; 10 TID n = 38; placebo n = 44). There
were no serious adverse events (AEs); the most common AEs included somatic
(headache, vomiting, nausea), neurobehavioral (irritability/agitation, anxiety,
hyperactivity), decreased appetite, and infectious conditions, many of which were
also common on placebo. In the combined studies, there were 13 discontinuations
(n = 12 arbaclofen, 1 placebo) due to AEs (all neurobehavioral). The
adolescent/adult study did not show benefit for arbaclofen over placebo for any
measure. In the child study, the highest dose group showed benefit over placebo
on the ABC-CFX Irritability subscale (p = 0.03) and Parenting Stress Index (PSI, 
p = 0.03) and trends toward benefit on the ABC-CFX Social Avoidance and
Hyperactivity subscales (both p < 0.1) and CGI-I (p = 0.119). Effect size in the 
highest dose group was similar to effect sizes for FDA-approved serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
CONCLUSIONS: Arbaclofen did not meet the primary outcome of improved social
avoidance in FXS in either study. Data from secondary measures in the child study
suggests younger patients may derive benefit, but additional studies with a
larger cohort on higher doses would be required to confirm this finding. The
reported studies illustrate the challenges but represent a significant step
forward in translating targeted treatments from preclinical models to clinical
trials in humans with FXS.

Sensory hypersensitivity is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),
including fragile X syndrome (FXS), and frequently leads to tactile
defensiveness. In mouse models of ASDs, there is mounting evidence of neuronal
and circuit hyperexcitability in several brain regions, which could contribute to
sensory hypersensitivity. However, it is not yet known whether or how sensory
stimulation might trigger abnormal sensory processing at the circuit level or
abnormal behavioral responses in ASD mouse models, especially during an early
developmental time when experience-dependent plasticity shapes such circuits.
Using a novel assay, we discovered exaggerated motor responses to whisker
stimulation in young Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice (postnatal days 14-16), a model of 
FXS. Adult Fmr1 KO mice actively avoided a stimulus that was innocuous to
wild-type controls, a sign of tactile defensiveness. Using in vivo two-photon
calcium imaging of layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons expressing GCaMP6s, we found
no differences between wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice in overall whisker-evoked
activity, though 45% fewer neurons in young Fmr1 KO mice responded in a
time-locked manner. Notably, we identified a pronounced deficit in neuronal
adaptation to repetitive whisker stimulation in both young and adult Fmr1 KO
mice. Thus, impaired adaptation in cortical sensory circuits is a potential cause
of tactile defensiveness in autism.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We use a novel paradigm
of repetitive whisker stimulation and in vivo calcium imaging to assess tactile
defensiveness and barrel cortex activity in young and adult Fmr1 knock-out mice, 
the mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). We describe evidence of tactile
defensiveness, as well as a lack of L2/3 neuronal adaptation in barrel cortex,
during whisker stimulation. We propose that a defect in sensory adaptation within
local neuronal networks, beginning at a young age and continuing into adulthood, 
likely contributes to sensory overreactivity in FXS and perhaps other ASDs.

BACKGROUND: Studies in the fmr1 KO mouse demonstrate hyper-excitability and
increased high-frequency neuronal activity in sensory cortex. These abnormalities
may contribute to prominent and distressing sensory hypersensitivities in
patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS). The current study investigated functional
properties of auditory cortex using a sensory entrainment task in FXS.
METHODS: EEG recordings were obtained from 17 adolescents and adults with FXS and
17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants heard an auditory chirp
stimulus generated using a 1000-Hz tone that was amplitude modulated by a
sinusoid linearly increasing in frequency from 0-100 Hz over 2 s.
RESULTS: Single trial time-frequency analyses revealed decreased gamma band
phase-locking to the chirp stimulus in FXS, which was strongly coupled with
broadband increases in gamma power. Abnormalities in gamma phase-locking and
power were also associated with theta-gamma amplitude-amplitude coupling during
the pre-stimulus period and with parent reports of heightened sensory
sensitivities and social communication deficits.
CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first demonstration of neural entrainment
alterations in FXS patients and suggests that fast-spiking interneurons
regulating synchronous high-frequency neural activity have reduced functionality.
This reduced ability to synchronize high-frequency neural activity was related to
the total power of background gamma band activity. These observations extend
findings from fmr1 KO models of FXS, characterize a core pathophysiological
aspect of FXS, and may provide a translational biomarker strategy for evaluating 
promising therapeutics.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a developmental disorder caused by a mutation in the 
X-linked FMR1 gene, coding for the FMRP protein which is largely involved in
synaptic function. FXS patients present several behavioral abnormalities,
including hyperactivity, anxiety, sensory hyper-responsiveness, and cognitive
deficits. Autistic symptoms, e.g., altered social interaction and communication, 
are also often observed: FXS is indeed the most common monogenic cause of autism.
Mouse models of FXS are therefore of great interest for research on both FXS and 
autistic pathologies. The Fmr1-KO2 mouse line is the most recent FXS model,
widely used for brain studies; surprisingly, little is known about the face
validity of this model, i.e., its FXS-like behavioral phenotype. Furthermore, no 
data are available for the age-related expression of the pathological phenotypes 
in this mouse line, a critical issue for modelling neurodevelopmental disorders. 
Here we performed an extensive behavioral characterization of the KO2 model at
infancy, adolescent and adult ages. Hyperactivity, altered emotionality, sensory 
hyper-responsiveness and memory deficits were already present in KO mice at
adolescence and remained evident at adulthood. Alterations in social behaviors
were instead observed only in young KO animals: during the first 2 weeks of life,
KOs emitted longer ultrasonic vocalizations compared to their WT littermates and 
as adolescents they displayed more aggressive behaviors towards a conspecific.
These results strongly support the face validity of the KO2 mouse as a model for 
FXS, at the same time demonstrating that its ability to recapitulate social
autistic-relevant phenotypes depends on early testing ages. Autism Res 2017, 10:

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a major impact on the development and social
integration of affected individuals and is the most heritable of psychiatric
disorders. An increase in the incidence of ASD cases has prompted a surge in
research efforts on the underlying neuropathologic processes. We present an
overview of current findings in neuropathology studies of ASD using two
investigational approaches, postmortem human brains and ASD animal models, and
discuss the overlap, limitations, and significance of each. Postmortem
examination of ASD brains has revealed global changes including disorganized gray
and white matter, increased number of neurons, decreased volume of neuronal soma,
and increased neuropil, the last reflecting changes in densities of dendritic
spines, cerebral vasculature and glia. Both cortical and non-cortical areas show 
region-specific abnormalities in neuronal morphology and cytoarchitectural
organization, with consistent findings reported from the prefrontal cortex,
fusiform gyrus, frontoinsular cortex, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala,
cerebellum and brainstem. The paucity of postmortem human studies linking
neuropathology to the underlying etiology has been partly addressed using animal 
models to explore the impact of genetic and non-genetic factors clinically
relevant for the ASD phenotype. Genetically modified models include those based
on well-studied monogenic ASD genes (NLGN3, NLGN4, NRXN1, CNTNAP2, SHANK3, MECP2,
FMR1, TSC1/2), emerging risk genes (CHD8, SCN2A, SYNGAP1, ARID1B, GRIN2B, DSCAM, 
TBR1), and copy number variants (15q11-q13 deletion, 15q13.3 microdeletion,
15q11-13 duplication, 16p11.2 deletion and duplication, 22q11.2 deletion). Models
of idiopathic ASD include inbred rodent strains that mimic ASD behaviors as well 
as models developed by environmental interventions such as prenatal exposure to
sodium valproate, maternal autoantibodies, and maternal immune activation. In
addition to replicating some of the neuropathologic features seen in postmortem
studies, a common finding in several animal models of ASD is altered density of
dendritic spines, with the direction of the change depending on the specific
genetic modification, age and brain region. Overall, postmortem neuropathologic
studies with larger sample sizes representative of the various ASD risk genes and
diverse clinical phenotypes are warranted to clarify putative etiopathogenic
pathways further and to promote the emergence of clinically relevant diagnostic
and therapeutic tools. In addition, as genetic alterations may render certain
individuals more vulnerable to developing the pathological changes at the synapse
underlying the behavioral manifestations of ASD, neuropathologic investigation
using genetically modified animal models will help to improve our understanding
of the disease mechanisms and enhance the development of targeted treatments.

Millions of people globally are at high risk for neurodegenerative disorders,
infertility or having children with a disability as a result of the Fragile X
(FX) premutation, a genetic abnormality in FMR1 that is underdiagnosed. Despite
the high prevalence of the FX premutation and its effect on public health and
family planning, most FX premutation carriers are unaware of their condition.
Since genetic testing for the premutation is resource intensive, it is not
practical to screen individuals for FX premutation status using genetic testing. 
In a novel approach to phenotyping, we have utilized audio recordings and
cognitive profiling assessed via self-administered questionnaires on 200 females.
Machine-learning methods were developed to discriminate FX premutation carriers
from mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders, the comparison group. By
using a random forest classifier, FX premutation carriers could be identified in 
an automated fashion with high precision and recall (0.81 F1 score). Linguistic
and cognitive phenotypes that were highly associated with FX premutation carriers
were high language dysfluency, poor ability to organize material, and low
self-monitoring. Our framework sets the foundation for computational phenotyping 
strategies to pre-screen large populations for this genetic variant with nominal 
costs.

The Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse has commonly been used to investigate communication 
impairments, one of the key diagnostic symptoms observed in Fragile X syndrome
(FXS) and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many studies have found alterations in 
ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in neonatal Fmr1 KO mice, however, there is
limited research investigating whether these deficits continue into adulthood. In
the present study, we examine differences in female urine-induced ultrasonic
vocalizations, scent marking behavior, odor discrimination, and open field
activity in adult male Fmr1 KO and wildtype (WT) mice. Overall, we found
extensive alterations between genotypes in both spectral and temporal properties 
of ultrasonic vocalizations. There was no difference in the average number of
calls emitted by both genotypes, however, Fmr1 KO mice emitted calls of a higher 
frequency, decreased amplitude, and shorter duration than WT mice. Spectrographic
analyses revealed statistically significant differences between genotypes in the 
types of calls emitted. Contrastingly, we found no differences in scent marking
behavior, a form of social communication, or in odor discrimination and activity 
levels of the mice. The results corroborate previous studies emphasizing the
importance of qualitative differences observed in vocalization behavior of Fmr1
KO mice, rather than quantitative measurements such as number of calls emitted.
Overall, the study confirms the presence of abnormalities in vocalization
behavior in adult Fmr1 KO mice that we believe are consistent with communication 
deficits seen in the syndrome.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
severe clinical symptoms such as the deficiency of the social communication,
repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, and restricted interests. Although complex 
genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the development of
ASD, the precise etiologies are largely unknown. Neuroanatomical observations
have been made of developmental abnormalities in different brain regions,
including dentate gyrus of hippocampus, which is widely accepted as the center
for learning and memory. However, little is known about what roles ASD-associated
genes play in the development of hippocampal dentate granule cells. In this
article, we summarized functions and pathophysiological significance of 6
representative ASD-associated genes, SEMA5A, PTEN, NLGN, EN-2, FMR1, and MECP2,
by focusing on the development of dentate gyrus. We then introduced a recently
developed gene transfer method directed to neonatal dentate granule cells. This
new method will be useful for elucidating physiological as well as
pathophysiological significance of ASD-associated genes in the development of
hippocampal formation.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum
disorders (ASD). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in FMR1 abolish FMRP expression,
leading to hyperactivation of ERK and mTOR signaling upstream of mRNA
translation. Here we show that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2
diabetes, rescues core phenotypes in Fmr1-/y mice and selectively normalizes ERK 
signaling, eIF4E phosphorylation and the expression of MMP-9. Thus, metformin is 
a potential FXS therapeutic.

BACKGROUND: NPAS3 has been established as a robust genetic risk factor in major
mental illness. In mice, loss of neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3) impairs
postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, while loss of the related protein NPAS1
promotes it. These and other findings suggest a critical role for NPAS proteins
in neuropsychiatric functioning, prompting interest in the molecular pathways
under their control.
METHODS: We used RNA sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing to identify genes directly regulated by NPAS1 and NPAS3 in the
hippocampus of wild-type, Npas1-/-, and Npas3-/- mice. Computational integration 
with human genetic and expression data revealed the disease relevance of
NPAS-regulated genes and pathways. Specific findings were confirmed at the
protein level by Western blot.
RESULTS: This is the first in vivo, transcriptome-scale investigation of genes
regulated by NPAS1 and NPAS3. These transcription factors control an ensemble of 
genes that are themselves also major regulators of neuropsychiatric function.
Specifically, Fmr1 (fragile X syndrome) and Ube3a (Angelman syndrome) are
transcriptionally regulated by NPAS3, as is the neurogenesis regulator Notch.
Dysregulation of these pathways was confirmed at the protein level. Furthermore, 
NPAS1/3 targets show increased human genetic burden for schizophrenia and
intellectual disability.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data provide a clear, unbiased view of the full
spectrum of genes regulated by NPAS1 and NPAS3 and show that these transcription 
factors are master regulators of neuropsychiatric function. These findings expose
the molecular pathophysiology of NPAS1/3 mutations and provide a striking example
of the shared, combinatorial nature of molecular pathways that underlie
diagnostically distinct neuropsychiatric conditions.

Existing assays of social interaction are suboptimal, and none measures
propinquity, the tendency of rodents to maintain close physical proximity. These 
assays are ubiquitously performed using inbred mouse strains and mutations placed
on inbred genetic backgrounds. We developed the automatable tube cooccupancy test
(TCOT) based on propinquity, the tendency of freely mobile rodents to maintain
close physical proximity, and assessed TCOT behavior on a variety of genotypes
and social and environmental conditions. In outbred mice and rats, familiarity
determined willingness to cooccupy the tube, with siblings and/or cagemates of
both sexes exhibiting higher cooccupancy behavior than strangers. Subsequent
testing using multiple genotypes revealed that inbred strain siblings do not
cooccupy at higher rates than strangers, in marked contrast to both outbred and
rederived wild mice. Mutant mouse strains with "autistic-like" phenotypes
(Fmr1-/y and Eif4e Ser209Ala) displayed significantly decreased cooccupancy.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual
disability and autism and affects ~1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. The
discovery of effective treatments for FXS has been hampered by the lack of
effective animal models and phenotypic readouts for drug screening. FXS ensues
from the epigenetic silencing or loss-of-function mutation of the fragile X
mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which encodes an RNA binding protein that
associates with and represses the translation of target mRNAs. We previously
found that the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) downstream of augmented
synthesis of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 2 receptor (BMPR2) promotes
aberrant synaptic development in mouse and Drosophila models of FXS and that
these molecular and cellular markers were correlated in patients with FXS. We
report that larval locomotion is augmented in a Drosophila FXS model. Genetic or 
pharmacological intervention on the BMPR2-LIMK pathway ameliorated the synaptic
abnormality and locomotion phenotypes of FXS larvae, as well as hyperactivity in 
an FXS mouse model. Our study demonstrates that (i) the BMPR2-LIMK pathway is a
promising therapeutic target for FXS and (ii) the locomotion phenotype of FXS
larvae is a quantitative functional readout for the neuromorphological phenotype 
associated with FXS and is amenable to the screening novel FXS therapeutics.

Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from FMR1 gene mutation that 
leads to intellectual disability, autism-like symptoms, and sensory
hypersensitivity. Arbaclofen, a GABA-B agonist, has shown efficacy in some
individuals with FXS but has become unavailable after unsuccessful clinical
trials, prompting interest in publicly available, racemic baclofen. The present
study investigated whether racemic baclofen can remediate abnormalities of neural
circuit function, sensory processing, and behavior in Fmr1 knockout mice, a
rodent model of fragile X syndrome. Fmr1 knockout mice showed increased baseline 
and auditory-evoked high-frequency gamma (30-80 Hz) power relative to C57BL/6
controls, as measured by electroencephalography. These deficits were accompanied 
by decreased T maze spontaneous alternation, decreased social interactions, and
increased open field center time, suggestive of diminished working memory,
sociability, and anxiety-like behavior, respectively. Abnormal auditory-evoked
gamma oscillations, working memory, and anxiety-related behavior were normalized 
by treatment with baclofen, but impaired sociability was not. Improvements in
working memory were evident predominantly in mice whose auditory-evoked gamma
oscillations were dampened by baclofen. These findings suggest that racemic
baclofen may be useful for targeting sensory and cognitive disturbances in
fragile X syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the second cause of intellectual
disability after Down syndrome and the most prevalent cause of intellectual
disability in males, affecting 1:5000-7000 men and 1:4000-6000 women. It is
caused by an alteration of the FMR1 gene, which maps at the Xq27.3 band: more
than 99% of individuals have a CGG expansion (>200 triplets) in the 5' UTR of the
gene, and FMR1 mutations and duplication/deletion are responsible for the
remaining (<1%) molecular diagnoses of FXS. The aim of this review was to gather 
the current clinical and molecular knowledge about FXS to provide clinicians with
a tool to guide the initial assessment and follow-up of FXS and to offer to
laboratory workers and researchers an update about the current diagnostic
procedures.
DISCUSSION: FXS is a well-known condition; however, most of the studies thus far 
have focused on neuropsychiatric features. Unfortunately, some of the available
studies have limitations, such as the paucity of patients enrolled or bias due to
the collection of the data in a single-country population, which may be not
representative of the average global FXS population. In recent years, insight
into the adult presentation of the disease has progressively increased.
Pharmacological treatment of FXS is essentially symptom based, but the growing
understanding of the molecular and biological mechanisms of the disease are
paving the way to targeted therapy, which may reverse the effects of FMRP
deficiency and be a real cure for the disease itself, not just its symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical spectrum of FXS is wide, presenting not only as an
isolated intellectual disability but as a multi-systemic condition, involving
predominantly the central nervous system but potentially affecting any apparatus.
Given the relative high frequency of the condition and its complex clinical
management, FXS appears to have an important economic and social burden.

KEY POINTS: Layer 2/3 neurons of the prefrontal cortex display higher gain of
somatic excitability, responding with a higher number of action potentials for a 
given stimulus, in fmr1-/y mice. In fmr1-/y L2/3 neurons, action potentials are
taller, faster and narrower. Outside-out patch clamp recordings revealed that the
maximum Na+ conductance density is higher in fmr1-/y L2/3 neurons. Measurements
of three biophysically distinct K+ currents revealed a depolarizing shift in the 
activation of a rapidly inactivating (A-type) K+ conductance. Realistic neuronal 
simulations of the biophysical observations recapitulated the elevated action
potential and repetitive firing phenotype.
ABSTRACT: Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental
impairment and autism. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher order
cognitive processing, and prefrontal dysfunction is believed to underlie many of 
the cognitive and behavioural phenotypes associated with fragile X syndrome. We
recently demonstrated that somatic and dendritic excitability of layer (L) 5
pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of the fmr1-/y mouse is significantly 
altered due to changes in several voltage-gated ion channels. In addition to L5
pyramidal neurons, L2/3 pyramidal neurons play an important role in prefrontal
circuitry, integrating inputs from both lower brain regions and the contralateral
cortex. Using whole-cell current clamp recording, we found that L2/3 pyramidal
neurons in prefrontal cortex of fmr1-/y mouse fired more action potentials for a 
given stimulus compared with wild-type neurons. In addition, action potentials in
fmr1-/y neurons were significantly larger, faster and narrower. Voltage clamp of 
outside-out patches from L2/3 neurons revealed that the transient Na+ current was
significantly larger in fmr1-/y neurons. Furthermore, the activation curve of
somatic A-type K+ current was depolarized. Realistic conductance-based
simulations revealed that these biophysical changes in Na+ and K+ channel
function could reliably reproduce the observed increase in action potential
firing and altered action potential waveform. These results, in conjunction with 
our prior findings on L5 neurons, suggest that principal neurons in the circuitry
of the medial prefrontal cortex are altered in distinct ways in the fmr1-/y mouse
and may contribute to dysfunctional prefrontal cortex processing in fragile X
syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients present neuronal alterations that lead to
severe intellectual disability, but the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms
are poorly understood. An emerging hypothesis postulates that reduced GABAergic
inhibition of excitatory neurons is a key component in the pathophysiology of
FXS. Here, we directly test this idea in a FXS Drosophila model. We show that FXS
flies exhibit strongly impaired olfactory behaviors. In line with this, olfactory
representations are less odor specific due to broader response tuning of
excitatory projection neurons. We find that impaired inhibitory interactions
underlie reduced specificity in olfactory computations. Finally, we show that
defective lateral inhibition across projection neurons is caused by weaker
inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. We provide direct evidence that deficient
inhibition impairs sensory computations and behavior in an in vivo model of FXS. 
Together with evidence of impaired inhibition in autism and Rett syndrome, these 
findings suggest a potentially general mechanism for intellectual disability.

Synaptic protein synthesis is essential for modification of the brain by
experience and is aberrant in several genetically defined disorders, notably
fragile X (FX), a heritable cause of autism and intellectual disability. Neural
activity directs local protein synthesis via activation of metabotropic glutamate
receptor 5 (mGlu5), yet how mGlu5 couples to the intracellular signaling pathways
that regulate mRNA translation is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence
that β-arrestin2 mediates mGlu5-stimulated protein synthesis in the hippocampus
and show that genetic reduction of β-arrestin2 corrects aberrant synaptic
plasticity and cognition in the Fmr1-/y mouse model of FX. Importantly, reducing 
β-arrestin2 does not induce psychotomimetic activity associated with full mGlu5
inhibitors and does not affect Gq signaling. Thus, in addition to identifying a
key requirement for mGlu5-stimulated protein synthesis, these data suggest that
β-arrestin2-biased negative modulators of mGlu5 offer significant advantages over
first-generation inhibitors for the treatment of FX and related disorders.

Maternal immune activation (MIA) via infection during pregnancy is known to
increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it is unclear how MIA 
disrupts fetal brain gene expression in ways that may explain this increased
risk. Here we examine how MIA dysregulates rat fetal brain gene expression (at a 
time point analogous to the end of the first trimester of human gestation) in
ways relevant to ASD-associated pathophysiology. MIA downregulates expression of 
ASD-associated genes, with the largest enrichments in genes known to harbor rare 
highly penetrant mutations. MIA also downregulates expression of many genes also 
known to be persistently downregulated in the ASD cortex later in life and which 
are canonically known for roles in affecting prenatally late developmental
processes at the synapse. Transcriptional and translational programs that are
downstream targets of highly ASD-penetrant FMR1 and CHD8 genes are also heavily
affected by MIA. MIA strongly upregulates expression of a large number of genes
involved in translation initiation, cell cycle, DNA damage and proteolysis
processes that affect multiple key neural developmental functions. Upregulation
of translation initiation is common to and preserved in gene network structure
with the ASD cortical transcriptome throughout life and has downstream impact on 
cell cycle processes. The cap-dependent translation initiation gene, EIF4E, is
one of the most MIA-dysregulated of all ASD-associated genes and targeted network
analyses demonstrate prominent MIA-induced transcriptional dysregulation of mTOR 
and EIF4E-dependent signaling. This dysregulation of translation initiation via
alteration of the Tsc2-mTor-Eif4e axis was further validated across MIA rodent
models. MIA may confer increased risk for ASD by dysregulating key aspects of
fetal brain gene expression that are highly relevant to pathophysiology affecting
ASD.

BACKGROUND: Cortical hyperexcitability due to abnormal fast-spiking inhibitory
interneuron function has been documented in fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model of the
fragile X syndrome which is the most common single gene cause of autism and
intellectual disability.
METHODS: We collected resting state dense-array electroencephalography data from 
21 fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients and 21 age-matched healthy participants.
RESULTS: FXS patients exhibited greater gamma frequency band power, which was
correlated with social and sensory processing difficulties. Second, FXS patients 
showed increased spatial spreading of phase-synchronized high frequency neural
activity in the gamma band. Third, we observed increased negative theta-to-gamma 
but decreased alpha-to-gamma band amplitude coupling, and the level of increased 
theta power was inversely related to the level of resting gamma power in FXS.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased theta band power and coupling from frontal sources may
represent a mechanism providing compensatory inhibition of high-frequency gamma
band activity, potentially contributing to the widely varying level of
neurophysiological and behavioral abnormalities and treatment response seen in
full-mutation FXS patients. These findings extend preclinical observations and
provide new mechanistic insights into brain alterations and their variability
across FXS patients. Electrophysiological measures may provide useful
translational biomarkers for advancing drug development and individualizing
treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders with associated neuronal
hyperexcitability.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a major developmental disorder and the most frequent 
monogenic cause of autism. Surprisingly, most existing studies on the Fmr1-KO
mouse model for FXS have focused on males, although FX women, who are mostly
heterozygous for the Fmr1 mutation, are known to exhibit several behavioral
deficits, including autistic-like features. Furthermore, most animal research has
been carried out on adults only; so that little is known about the age
progression of the behavioral phenotype of Fmr1 mutants, which is a crucial issue
to optimize the impact of therapeutic interventions. Here, we performed an
extensive analysis of autistic-like social behaviors in heterozygous (HET)
Fmr1-KO females and their WT littermates at different ages. No behavioral
difference between HET and WT mice was observed at infancy, but some
abnormalities in social interaction and communication were first detected at
juvenile age. At adulthood some of these alterations disappeared, but avoidance
of social novelty appeared, together with other FXS-relevant behavioral deficits,
such as hyperactivity and reduced contextual fear response. Our data provide for 
the first time evidence for the presence of autistic-relevant behavioral
abnormalities in Fmr1-HET female mice, demonstrating the utility of this mouse
line to model autistic-like behaviors in both sexes. These results also highlight
the importance of taking into account age differences when using the Fmr1-KO
mouse model, suggesting that the early post-natal phases are the most promising
target for preventive interventions and the adult age is the most appropriate to 
investigate the behavioral impact of potential therapies. Autism Res 2017. © 2017

OBJECTIVE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and tuberous sclerosis (TSC) are genetic
disorders that result in intellectual disability and an increased prevalence of
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). While the clinical presentation of each disorder
is distinct, the molecular causes are linked to a disruption in the mTORC1
(mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) and ERK1/2 (Extracellular
signal-Regulated Kinase) signaling pathways.
METHODS: We assessed the clinical and molecular characteristics of an individual 
seen at the UC Davis MIND Institute with a diagnosis of FXS and TSC. Clinical
evaluation of physical, behavioral, and cognitive impairments were performed.
Additionally, total and phosphorylated proteins along the mTORC1 and ERK1/2
pathways were measured in primary fibroblast cell lines from the proband.
RESULTS: In this case the phenotypic effects that result in a human with both FXS
and TSC are shown to be severe. Changes in mTORC1 and ERK1/2 signaling proteins
and global protein synthesis were not found to be noticeably different between
four cohorts (typically developing, FMR1 full mutation, FMR1 full mutation and
TSC1 loss of function mutation, and TSC1 loss of function mutation); however
cohort sizes prevented stringent comparisons.
CONCLUSION: It has previously been suggested that disruption of the mTORC1
pathway was reciprocal in TSC and FXS double knock-out mouse models so that the
regulation of these pathways were more similar to wild-type mice compared to mice
harboring a Fmr1-/y or Tsc2-/+ mutation alone. However, in this first reported
case of a human with a diagnosis of both FXS and TSC, substantial clinical
impairments, as a result of these two disorders were observed. Differences in the
mTORC and ERK1/2 pathways were not clearly established when compared between
individuals with either disorder, or both.

Fragile X syndrome, the most common known monogenic cause of autism, results from
the loss of FMR1, a conserved, ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein. Recent
evidence suggests that Fragile X syndrome and other types of autism are
associated with immune system defects. We found that Drosophila melanogaster Fmr1
mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to bacterial infection and decreased
phagocytosis of bacteria by systemic immune cells. Using tissue-specific
RNAi-mediated knockdown, we showed that Fmr1 plays a cell-autonomous role in the 
phagocytosis of bacteria. Fmr1 mutants also exhibit delays in two processes that 
require phagocytosis by glial cells, the immune cells in the brain: neuronal
clearance after injury in adults and the development of the mushroom body, a
brain structure required for learning and memory. Delayed neuronal clearance is
associated with reduced recruitment of activated glia to the site of injury.
These results suggest a previously unrecognized role for Fmr1 in regulating the
activation of phagocytic immune cells both in the body and the brain.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by the loss of functional FMRP, is a leading
cause of autism. Neurons lacking FMRP show aberrant mRNA translation and
intracellular signalling. Here, we identify that, in Fmr1 knockout neurons, type 
1 adenylyl cyclase (Adcy1) mRNA translation is enhanced, leading to excessive
production of ADCY1 protein and insensitivity to neuronal stimulation. Genetic
reduction of Adcy1 normalizes the aberrant ERK1/2- and PI3K-mediated signalling, 
attenuates excessive protein synthesis and corrects dendritic spine abnormality
in Fmr1 knockout mice. Genetic reduction of Adcy1 also ameliorates autism-related
symptoms including repetitive behaviour, defective social interaction and
audiogenic seizures. Moreover, peripheral administration of NB001, an
experimental compound that preferentially suppresses ADCY1 activity over other
ADCY subtypes, attenuates the behavioural abnormalities in Fmr1 knockout mice.
These results demonstrate a connection between the elevated Adcy1 translation and
abnormal ERK1/2 signalling and behavioural symptoms in FXS.

Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1) is a candidate gene for
intellectual disability (ID), autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. It is a member 
of a family of proteins that is highly conserved during evolution, sharing high
homology with its Drosophila homolog, dCYFIP. CYFIP1 interacts with the Fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP, encoded by the FMR1 gene), whose absence causes
Fragile X syndrome, and with the translation initiation factor eIF4E. It is a
member of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), thus representing a link between
translational regulation and the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we present data
showing a correlation between mRNA levels of CYFIP1 and other members of the WRC.
This suggests a tight regulation of the levels of the WRC members, not only by
post-translational mechanisms, as previously hypothesized. Moreover, we studied
the impact of loss of function of both CYFIP1 and FMRP on neuronal growth and
differentiation in two animal models - fly and mouse. We show that these two
proteins antagonize each other's function not only during neuromuscular junction 
growth in the fly but also during new neuronal differentiation in the olfactory
bulb of adult mice. Mechanistically, FMRP and CYFIP1 modulate mTor signaling in
an antagonistic manner, likely via independent pathways, supporting the results
obtained in mouse as well as in fly at the morphological level. Collectively, our
results illustrate a new model to explain the cellular roles of FMRP and CYFIP1
and the molecular significance of their interaction.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a repeat expansion mutation near the FMR1
gene promoter and is the most common form of heritable intellectual disability
and autism. Full mutations larger than 200 CGG repeats trigger FMR1
heterochromatinization and loss of gene expression, which is primarily
responsible for the pathological features of FXS . In contrast, smaller
pre-mutations of 55–200 CGG are associated with FMR1 overexpression and Fragile
X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative
condition. While the role of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in FMR1 gene silencing has
been studied extensively, the role of 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC), a newly
discovered epigenetic mark produced through active DNA demethylation, has not
been previously investigated in FXS neurons. Here, we used two complementary
epigenetic assays, 5hmC sensitive restriction digest and ten-eleven
translocation-assisted bisulfite pyrosequencing, to quantify FMR1 5mC and 5hmC
levels. We observed increased levels of 5hmC at the FMR1 promoter in FXS patient 
brains with full-mutations relative to pre-mutation carriers and unaffected
controls. In addition, we found that 5hmC enrichment at the FMR1 locus in FXS
cells is specific to neurons by utilizing a nuclei sorting technique to separate 
neuronal and glial DNA fractions from post-mortem brain tissues. This FMR1 5hmC
enrichment was not present in cellular models of FXS including fibroblasts,
lymphocytes and reprogrammed neurons, indicating they do not fully recapitulate
this epigenetic feature of disease. Future studies could investigate the
potential to leverage this epigenetic pathway to restore FMR1 expression and
discern whether levels of 5hmC correlate with phenotypic severity.

New research suggests that common pathways are altered in many neurodevelopmental
disorders including autism spectrum disorder; however, little is known about
early molecular events that contribute to the pathology of these diseases. The
study of monogenic, neurodevelopmental disorders with a high incidence of
autistic behaviours, such as fragile X syndrome, has the potential to identify
genes and pathways that are dysregulated in autism spectrum disorder as well as
fragile X syndrome. In vitro generation of human disease-relevant cell types
provides the ability to investigate aspects of disease that are impossible to
study in patients or animal models. Differentiation of human pluripotent stem
cells recapitulates development of the neocortex, an area affected in both
fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. We have generated induced human 
pluripotent stem cells from several individuals clinically diagnosed with fragile
X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. When differentiated to dorsal forebrain 
cell fates, our fragile X syndrome human pluripotent stem cell lines exhibited
reproducible aberrant neurogenic phenotypes. Using global gene expression and DNA
methylation profiling, we have analysed the early stages of neurogenesis in
fragile X syndrome human pluripotent stem cells. We discovered aberrant DNA
methylation patterns at specific genomic regions in fragile X syndrome cells, and
identified dysregulated gene- and network-level correlates of fragile X syndrome 
that are associated with developmental signalling, cell migration, and neuronal
maturation. Integration of our gene expression and epigenetic analysis identified
altered epigenetic-mediated transcriptional regulation of a distinct set of genes
in fragile X syndrome. These fragile X syndrome-aberrant networks are
significantly enriched for genes associated with autism spectrum disorder, giving
support to the idea that underlying similarities exist among these
neurodevelopmental diseases.

The Fragile X syndrome (FXS) as the most common monogenetic cause of cognitive
impairment and autism indicates how tightly the dysregulation of synapse
development is linked to cognitive deficits. Symptoms of FXS include excessive
adherence to patterns that point to compromised hippocampal network formation.
Surprisingly, one of the most complex hippocampal synapses connecting the dentate
gyrus (DG) to CA3 pyramidal neurons has not been analyzed in FXS yet.
Intriguingly, we found altered synaptic function between DG and CA3 in a mouse
model of FXS (fmr1 knockout [KO]) demonstrated by increased mossy fiber-dependent
miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency at CA3 pyramidal
neurons together with increased connectivity between granule cells and CA3
neurons. This phenotype is accompanied by increased activity of fmr1 KO animals
in the marble burying task, detecting repetitive and obsessive compulsive
behavior. Spine apparatus development and insertion of AMPA receptors is enhanced
at postsynaptic thorny excrescences (TEs) in fmr1 KO mice. We report
age-dependent alterations in TE morphology and in the underlying actin dynamics
possibly linked to a dysregulation in profilin1 expression. TEs form detonator
synapses guiding CA3 network activity. Thus, alterations described here are
likely to contribute substantially to the impairment in hippocampal function and 
therefore to the pathogenesis of FXS.

BACKGROUND: Targeting overlapping behavioral phenotypes in neurogenetic disorders
can help elucidate gene-behavior relationships. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been studied as a model for this approach,
and important areas of phenotypic overlap and divergence have been documented.
However, few studies have examined how the manifestation of ASD-related
phenotypes in FXS may change over development, a question which has important
implications for conceptualizing shared etiologies of these disorders and their
constituent phenotypes. The goal of this study was to characterize ASD phenotypes
in boys and girls with FXS across development, as well as to compare individual
component phenotypes among boys with FXS and boys with idiopathic ASD (ASD-O)
over time.
METHODS: Sixty-five boys and girls with FXS and 19 boys with ASD-O completed a
battery of diagnostic, cognitive, and language assessments at two time points
(mean 2.5 years apart). Nonparametric tests assessed changes in diagnostic
classification in FXS over time, and hierarchical linear modeling and repeated
measures assessed changes in individual ASD symptoms in FXS over time.
Additionally, ANCOVAs compared ASD symptom severity and component phenotypes in
boys with FXS-O, FXS-ASD, and ASD-O at both time points.
RESULTS: Overall, ASD symptom manifestation for children with FXS significantly
increased over time, and developmental predictors varied based on the domain of
symptoms assessed. The greatest degree of overlap was observed between boys with 
FXS-ASD and ASD-O in the domain of reciprocal social communication across time
points, whereas boys with ASD-O demonstrated greater impairment in restricted and
repetitive behaviors at the later time point.
CONCLUSIONS: ASD symptoms increased in FXS with age, and social language
impairment emerged as a potential core shared feature of FXS and ASD that may
help elucidate underlying molecular genetic variation related to phenotypic
variance, and aid intervention planning for subgroups of children showing
distinct phenotypes. Results highlight the value of a developmental perspective, 
and longitudinal data in particular, in evaluating shared behavioral phenotypes
across genetic conditions, lending insight into underlying cognitive, neural, and
genetic mechanisms associated with key developmental phenotypes in ASD and FXS.

Many clinical and molecular features of the fragile X syndrome, a common form of 
intellectual disability and autism, can be modeled by deletion of the Fmr1
protein (Fmrp) in mice. Previous studies showed a decreased expression of several
components of the GABAergic system in Fmr1 knockout mice. Here, we used this
mouse model to investigate the functional consequences of Fmrp deletion on
hippocampal GABAergic inhibition in the CA1-region of the hippocampus. Whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings demonstrated a significantly reduced amplitude of evoked
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and a decrease in the amplitude and
frequency of spontaneous IPSCs. In addition, miniature IPSCs were reduced in
amplitude and frequency and decayed significantly slower than mIPSCs in controls.
Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a significantly lower expression of α2, β1
and δ GABAA receptor subunits in the hippocampus of the juvenile mice (P22)
compared to wild-type littermates. Correspondingly, we found also at the protein 
level reduced amounts of α2, β1 and δ subunits in Fmr1 knockout mice. Overall,
these results demonstrate that the reduction in several components of the
GABAergic system is already present at young age and that this reduction results 
in measurable abnormalities on GABAA receptor-mediated phasic inhibition. These
abnormalities might contribute to the behavioral and cognitive deficits of this
fragile X mouse model.

The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA-binding regulator of
protein translation that associates with 4-6% of brain transcripts and is central
to neurodevelopment. Autism risk genes' transcripts are overrepresented among
FMRP-binding mRNAs, and FMRP loss-of-function mutations are responsible for
fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of monogenetic autism. It is thought
that FMRP-dependent translational repression is governed by the phosphorylation
of serine residue 499 (S499). However, recent evidence suggests that S499
phosphorylation is not modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptor class I
(mGluR-I) or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), two molecules shown to regulate FMRP 
translational repression. Moreover, the mammalian FMRP S499 kinase remains
unknown. We found that casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylates murine FMRP S499.
Further, we show that phosphorylation of FMRP S499 permits phosphorylation of
additional, nearby residues. Evidence suggests that these nearby residues are
modulated by mGluR-I and PP2A pathways. These data support an alternative
phosphodynamic model of FMRP that is harmonious with prior studies and serves as 
a framework for further investigation.

In the developing brain, neurons are produced from neural stem cells termed
radial glia [1, 2]. Radial glial progenitors span the neuroepithelium, extending 
long basal processes to form endfeet hundreds of micrometers away from the soma. 
Basal structures influence neuronal migration, tissue integrity, and
proliferation [3-7]. Yet, despite the significance of these distal structures,
their cell biology remains poorly characterized, impeding our understanding of
how basal processes and endfeet influence neurogenesis. Here we use live imaging 
of embryonic brain tissue to visualize, for the first time, rapid mRNA transport 
in radial glia, revealing that the basal process is a highway for directed
molecular transport. RNA- and mRNA-binding proteins, including the syndromic
autism protein FMRP, move in basal processes at velocities consistent with
microtubule-based transport, accumulating in endfeet. We develop an ex vivo
tissue preparation to mechanically isolate radial glia endfeet from the soma, and
we use photoconvertible proteins to demonstrate that mRNA is locally translated. 
Using RNA immunoprecipitation and microarray analyses of endfeet, we discover
FMRP-bound transcripts, which encode signaling and cytoskeletal regulators,
including many implicated in autism and neurogenesis. We show FMRP controls
transport and localization of one target, Kif26a. These discoveries reveal a
rich, regulated local transcriptome in radial glia, far from the soma, and
establish a tractable mammalian model for studying mRNA transport and local
translation in vivo. We conclude that cytoskeletal and signaling events at
endfeet may be controlled through translation of specific mRNAs transported from 
the soma, exposing new mechanistic layers within stem cells of the developing
brain.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability and autism, caused by a CGG expansion to greater than 200 repeats in
the promoter region of FMR1 on the bottom of the X chromosome. A subgroup of
individuals with FXS experience hyperphagia, lack of satiation after meals and
severe obesity, this subgroup is referred to have the Prader-Willi phenotype of
FXS. Prader-Willi syndrome is one of the most common genetic severe obesity
disorders known and it is caused by the lack of the paternal 15q11-13 region.
Affected individuals suffer from hyperphagia, lack of satiation, intellectual
disability, and behavioral problems. Children with fragile X syndrome
Prader-Willi phenotye and those with Prader Willi syndrome have clinical and
molecular similarities reviewed here which will impact new treatment options for 
both disorders.

School of Medicine in Katowice, Katowice, Poland.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retardation
and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS
is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene, 
resulting in the transcriptional silencing of the gene. Leptin may be considered 
a cytokine-like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the 
regulation of neuroendocrine functions and the immune system response, in
addition to playing a role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in
parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. The involvement of leptin and
adiponectin in the pathophysiology of FXS was hypothesized.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
Twenty-three male patients affected by FXS (full mutation in the FMR1 gene) and
24 controls were included in the study. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were
measured by the ELISA method using commercially available kits.
RESULTS: Adiponectin levels in FXS patients were significantly lower than those
found in controls (p < 0.04). Leptin levels in FXS patients were significantly
higher than those found in controls (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Adipokines may be involved in the psychiatric features observed in
FXS patients. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the role of
adiponectin and leptin in FXS.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG
binding protein 2 (MECP2), an epigenetic regulator of mRNA transcription. Here,
we report a test of the hypothesis of shared pathophysiology of RTT and fragile
X, another monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. In fragile X,
the loss of the mRNA translational repressor FMRP leads to exaggerated protein
synthesis downstream of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We found that
mGluR5- and protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity were similarly
altered in area CA1 of Mecp2 KO mice. CA1 pyramidal cell-type-specific,
genome-wide profiling of ribosome-bound mRNAs was performed in wild-type and
Mecp2 KO hippocampal CA1 neurons to reveal the MeCP2-regulated "translatome." We 
found significant overlap between ribosome-bound transcripts overexpressed in the
Mecp2 KO and FMRP mRNA targets. These tended to encode long genes that were
functionally related to either cytoskeleton organization or the development of
neuronal connectivity. In the Fmr1 KO mouse, chronic treatment with
mGluR5-negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) has been shown to ameliorate many
mutant phenotypes by correcting excessive protein synthesis. In Mecp2 KO mice, we
found that mGluR5 NAM treatment significantly reduced the level of overexpressed 
ribosome-associated transcripts, particularly those that were also FMRP targets. 
Some Rett phenotypes were also ameliorated by treatment, most notably hippocampal
cell size and lifespan. Together, these results suggest a potential mechanistic
link between MeCP2-mediated transcription regulation and mGluR5/FMRP-mediated
protein translation regulation through coregulation of a subset of genes relevant
to synaptic functions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Altered regulation of synaptic
protein synthesis has been hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology that
underlies multiple forms of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.
Here, we show in a mouse model of Rett syndrome (Mecp2 KO) that metabotropic
glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)- and protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic
plasticity are abnormal in the hippocampus. We found that a subset of
ribosome-bound mRNAs was aberrantly upregulated in hippocampal CA1 neurons of
Mecp2 KO mice, that these significantly overlapped with FMRP direct targets
and/or SFARI human autism genes, and that chronic treatment of Mecp2 KO mice with
an mGluR5-negative allosteric modulator tunes down upregulated ribosome-bound
mRNAs and partially improves mutant mice phenotypes.

Neuroligins are post-synaptic, cellular adhesion molecules implicated in synaptic
formation and function. NLGN2 is strongly linked to inhibitory, GABAergic
signaling and is crucial for maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance in the
brain. Disruption of the excitation-inhibition balance is associated with
neuropsychiatric disease. In animal models, altered NLGN2 expression causes
anxiety, developmental delay, motor discoordination, social impairment,
aggression, and sensory processing defects. In humans, mutations in NLGN3 and
NLGN4 are linked to autism and schizophrenia; NLGN2 missense variants are
implicated in schizophrenia. Copy number variants encompassing NLGN2 on 17p13.1
are associated with autism, intellectual disability, metabolic syndrome,
diabetes, and dysmorphic features, but an isolated NLGN2 nonsense variant has not
yet been described in humans. Here, we describe a 15-year-old male with severe
anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, developmental delay, autism, obesity,
macrocephaly, and some dysmorphic features. Exome sequencing identified a
heterozygous, de novo, c.441C>A p.(Tyr147Ter) variant in NLGN2 that is predicted 
to cause loss of normal protein function. This is the first report of an NLGN2
nonsense variant in humans, adding to the accumulating evidence that links
synaptic proteins with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. © 2016 Wiley

With widespread adoption of fragile X carrier screening in pregnant women, the
number of expectant couples receiving news of an unanticipated Fragile X Mental
Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene expansion has increased. The most common abnormal
result from maternal FMR1 testing involves an intermediate allele, also known as 
a gray zone result, which requires genetic counseling but poses minimal risk for 
an adverse developmental outcome. By contrast, the finding of a maternal FMR1
premutation or full mutation during pregnancy has important implications for the 
woman herself, her unborn child, and her extended family. These multiple levels
of impact, in addition to the complex inheritance pattern and variable
expressivity of fragile X-associated disorders, cause significant stress for
newly identified expectant couples and pose unique challenges for genetic
counselors in the prenatal setting. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual
disability and autism. FXS results from the absence of FMRP, an RNA binding
protein associated to ribosomes that influences the translation of specific mRNAs
in post-synaptic compartments of neurons. The main molecular consequence of the
absence of FMRP is an excessive translation of neuronal protein in several areas 
of the brain. This local protein synthesis deregulation is proposed to underlie
the defect in synaptic plasticity responsible for FXS. Recent findings in neurons
of the fragile X mouse model (Fmr1-KO) uncovered another consequence of the lack 
of FMRP: a deregulation of the diacylglycerol (DAG)/phosphatidic acid (PA)
homeostasis. DAG and PA are two interconvertible lipids that influence membrane
architecture and that act as essential signaling molecules that activate various 
downstream effectors, including master regulators of local protein synthesis and 
actin polymerization. As a consequence, DAG and PA govern a variety of cellular
processes, including cell proliferation, vesicle/membrane trafficking and
cytoskeletal organization. At the synapse, the level of these lipids is proposed 
to influence the synaptic activation status. FMRP appears as a master regulator
of this neuronal process by controlling the translation of a diacylglycerol
kinase enzyme that converts DAG into PA. The deregulated levels of DAG and PA
caused by the absence of FMRP could represent a novel therapeutic target for the 
treatment of FXS.

    Front Mol Neurosci. 2017 Feb 07;10 :29.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and a leading cause of autism. FXS is due to the silencing of the
Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein mainly
involved in translational control, dendritic spine morphology and synaptic
plasticity. Despite extensive studies, there is currently no cure for FXS. With
the purpose to decipher the initial molecular events leading to this pathology,
we developed a stem-cell-based disease model by knocking-down the expression of
Fmr1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Repressing FMRP in ESCs increased the 
expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Ascl1. When inducing neuronal
differentiation, βIII-tubulin, p27kip1 , NeuN, and NeuroD1 were upregulated,
leading to an accelerated neuronal differentiation that was partially compensated
at later stages. Interestingly, we observed that neurogenesis is also accelerated
in the embryonic brain of Fmr1-knockout mice, indicating that our cellular model 
recapitulates the molecular alterations present in vivo. Importantly, we rescued 
the main phenotype of the Fmr1 knockdown cell line, not only by reintroducing
FMRP but also by pharmacologically targeting APP processing, showing the role of 
this protein in the pathophysiology of FXS during the earliest steps of
neurogenesis. Our work allows to define an early therapeutic window but also to
identify more effective molecules for treating this disorder. Stem Cells

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is characterised by features including anxiety and
autistic-like behaviour, which led to early hypotheses that aberrant
physiological arousal may underlie the behavioural phenotype. In line with this, 
several lines of evidence suggest that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis may be altered in the syndrome. This review collates evidence to determine
the nature of HPA axis baseline activity and reactivity (as measured by
glucocorticoid levels) differences in FXS, and its relationship to behaviour.
Through a search of electronic databases, 15 papers were identified which
provided data on humans with FXS or the FMR1 knockout mouse model. The findings
across studies are mixed, though trends in the findings can be seen, including
elevations in cortisol levels, particularly in males. Preliminary findings also
highlight associations between cortisol levels and key behaviours associated with
the syndrome, such as gaze avoidance. Areas for future research are discussed.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic cause of intellectual
disability and autism. Molecular diagnostic testing of FXS and related disorders 
(fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and fragile
X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)) relies on a combination of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot (SB) for the fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) CGG-repeat expansion and methylation analyses. Recent
advancements in PCR-based technologies have enabled the characterization of the
complete spectrum of CGG-repeat mutation, with or without methylation assessment,
and, as a result, have reduced our reliance on the labor- and time-intensive SB, 
which is the gold standard FXS diagnostic test. The newer and more robust
triplet-primed PCR or TP-PCR assays allow the mapping of AGG interruptions and
enable the predictive analysis of the risks of unstable CGG expansion during
mother-to-child transmission. In this review, we have summarized the correlation 
between several molecular elements, including CGG-repeat size, methylation,
mosaicism and skewed X-chromosome inactivation, and the extent of clinical
involvement in patients with FMR1-related disorders, and reviewed key
developments in PCR-based methodologies for the molecular diagnosis of FXS, FXTAS
and FXPOI, and large-scale (CGG)n expansion screening in newborns, women of
reproductive age and high-risk populations.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is absent or highly reduced in
Fragile X Syndrome, a genetic disorder causing cognitive impairment and autistic 
behaviors. Previous proof-of-principle studies have demonstrated that restoring
FMRP in the brain using viral vectors can improve pathological abnormalities in
mouse models of fragile X. However, unlike small molecule drugs where the dose
can readily be adjusted during treatment, viral vector-based biological
therapeutic drugs present challenges in terms of achieving optimal dosing and
expression levels. The objective of this study was to investigate the
consequences of expressing varying levels of FMRP selectively in neurons of Fmr1 
knockout and wild-type (WT) mice. A wide range of neuronal FMRP transgene levels 
was achieved in individual mice after intra-cerebroventricular administration of 
adeno-associated viral vectors coding for FMRP. In all treated knockout mice,
prominent FMRP transgene expression was observed in forebrain structures, whereas
lower levels were present in more caudal regions of the brain. Reduced levels of 
the synaptic protein PSD-95, elevated levels of the transcriptional modulator
MeCP2, and abnormal motor activity, anxiety, and acoustic startle responses in
Fmr1 knockout mice were fully or partially rescued after expression of FMRP at
about 35-115% of WT expression, depending on the brain region examined. In the WT
mouse, moderate FMRP over-expression of up to about twofold had little or no
effect on PSD-95 and MeCP2 levels or on behavioral endophenotypes. In contrast,
excessive over-expression in the Fmr1 knockout mouse forebrain (approximately
2.5-6-fold over WT) induced pathological motor hyperactivity and suppressed the
startle response relative to WT mice. These results delineate a range of FMRP
expression levels in the central nervous system that confer phenotypic
improvement in fragile X mice. Collectively, these findings are pertinent to the 
development of long-term curative gene therapy strategies for treating Fragile X 
Syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common cause of intellectual disability
and autism, results from the expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5'
untranslated region of the FMR1 gene to >200 repeats. Such expanded alleles,
known as full mutation (FM) alleles, are epigenetically silenced in
differentiated cells thus resulting in the loss of FMRP, a protein important for 
learning and memory. The timing of repeat expansion and FMR1 gene silencing is
controversial.
METHODS: We monitored the repeat size and methylation status of FMR1 alleles with
expanded CGG repeats in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that were grown for extended period of time
either as stem cells or differentiated into neurons. We used a PCR assay
optimized for the amplification of large CGG repeats for sizing, and a
quantitative methylation-specific PCR for the analysis of FMR1 promoter
methylation. The FMR1 mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. FMRP levels were
determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation was used to study the association of repressive histone marks
with the FMR1 gene in FXS ESCs.
RESULTS: We show here that while FMR1 gene silencing can be seen in FXS embryonic
stem cells (ESCs), some silenced alleles contract and when the repeat number
drops below ~400, DNA methylation erodes, even when the repeat number remains
>200. The resultant active alleles do not show the large step-wise expansions
seen in stem cells from other repeat expansion diseases. Furthermore, there may
be selection against large active alleles and these alleles do not expand further
or become silenced on neuronal differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypotheses that (i) large expansions occur
prezygotically or in the very early embryo, (ii) large unmethylated alleles may
be deleterious in stem cells, (iii) methylation can occur on alleles with >400
repeats very early in embryogenesis, and (iv) expansion and contraction may occur
by different mechanisms. Our data also suggest that the threshold for stable
methylation of FM alleles may be higher than previously thought. A higher
threshold might explain why some carriers of FM alleles escape methylation. It
may also provide a simple explanation for why silencing has not been observed in 
mouse models with >200 repeats.

Most Martin-Bell syndrome (FMR1-related disorder) Venezuelan patients did not
show CGG expansion but instead display genetic heterogeneity.

Martin-Bell syndrome is mainly caused by the expansion of CGG trinucleotide
repeats (>200 CGG) in the first exon of the FMR1 gene, leading to
hypermethylation of the promoter region and silencing of the FMR1 protein
expression. These changes are responsible for a phenotype with varying degrees of
mental retardation, a long face with large and protruding ears, macroorchidism
and autistic behavior. There may also be, however, patients who exhibit typical
features of the syndrome without any expansion in the FMR1 gene; thus, other
mechanisms affecting the expression of the FMR1 gene were assessed in 25 out of
29 ascertained patients with the typical phenotype without full mutation.
Promoter methylation status of FMR1, mutations in its sequence and copy number
variations (CNVs) in genes associated with intellectual disability were
investigated. In 25 independent male patients without expansion, the promoter
region was unmethylated; one patient with a full mutation showed methylation
mosaicism; and a female patient had 81.2% of CpG sites methylated and 18.8%
hemimethylated. One heterozygous duplication in exon 6 of the PDCD6 gene
(programmed cell death 6) and a heterozygous deletion in exon 5 of the CHL1 gene 
(cell adhesion molecule L1), respectively, were found in two independent
patients.

CGG repeat expansion >200 within FMR1, termed full mutation (FM), has been
associated with promoter methylation, consequent silencing of gene expression and
fragile X syndrome (FXS)-a common cause of intellectual disability and co-morbid 
autism. Unmethylated premutation (55-199 repeats) and FM alleles have been
associated with fragile X related tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset
neurodegenerative disorder. Here we present a 33-year-old male with FXS, with
white matter changes and progressive deterioration in gait with cerebellar signs 
consistent with probable FXTAS; there was no evidence of any other cerebellar
pathology. We show that he has tissue mosaicism in blood, saliva, and buccal
samples for the size and methylation of his expanded alleles and a de novo,
unmethylated microdeletion. This microdeletion involves a ∼80 bp sequence in the 
FMR1 promoter as well as complete loss of the CGG repeat in a proportion of
cells. Despite FMR1 mRNA levels in blood within the normal range, the methylation
and CGG sizing results are consistent with the diagnosis of concurrent FXS and
probable FXTAS. The demonstrated presence of unmethylated FM alleles would
explain the manifestation of milder than expected cognitive and behavioral
impairments and early onset of cerebellar ataxia. Our case suggests that
individuals with FXS, who manifest symptoms of FXTAS, may benefit from more
detailed laboratory testing. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) belongs to the broad spectrum of genetic
disorders associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD were reported
predominantly in congenital and early childhood forms of DM1. We describe
dizygotic twin boys with ASD who were referred for routine laboratory genetic
testing and in whom karyotyping, FMR1 gene testing, and single nucleotide
polymorphism array analysis yielded negative results. The father of the boys was 
later diagnosed with suspected DM1, and testing revealed characteristic DMPK gene
expansions in his genome as well as in the genomes of both twins and their elder 
brother, who also suffered from ASD. In accord with previous reports on childhood
forms of DM1, our patients showed prominent neuropsychiatric phenotypes
characterized especially by hypotonia, developmental and language delay,
emotional and affective lability, lowered adaptability, and social withdrawal.
The experience with this family and multiple literature reports of ASD in DM1 on 
the one side but the lack of literature data on the frequency of DMPK gene
expansions in ASD patients on the other side prompted us to screen the DMPK gene 
in a sample of 330 patients with ASD who were first seen by a geneticist before
they were 10 years of age, before the muscular weakness, which may signal DM1,
usually becomes obvious. The absence of any DMPK gene expansions in this cohort
indicates that targeted DMPK gene testing can be recommended only in ASD patients
with specific symptoms or family history suggestive of DM1.

The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene, which codes for the fragile X mental
retardation 1 protein, usually has 5 to 40 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated
promoter. The full mutation is the almost always the cause of fragile X syndrome 
(FXS). The prevalence of FXS is about 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 7,000 in the general
population although the prevalence varies in different regions of the world. FXS 
is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. The
understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has led to many targeted treatments, but
none have cured this disorder. The treatment of the medical problems and
associated behaviors remain the most useful intervention for children with FXS.
In this review, we focus on the non-pharmacological and pharmacological
management of medical and behavioral problems associated with FXS as well as
current recommendations for follow-up and surveillance.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable cause of intellectual
disability and a leading genetic form of autism. The Fmr1 KO mouse, a model of
FXS, exhibits elevated translation in the hippocampus and the cortex. ERK
(extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of
rapamycin) signaling regulate protein synthesis by activating downstream targets 
critical to translation initiation and elongation and are known to contribute to 
hippocampal defects in fragile X. Here we show that the effect of loss of fragile
X mental retardation protein (FMRP) on these pathways is brain region specific.
In contrast to the hippocampus, ERK (but not mTOR) signaling is elevated in the
neocortex of fragile X mice. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, typically a
downstream target of mTOR, is elevated in the neocortex, despite normal mTOR
activity. This is significant in that S6 phosphorylation facilitates translation,
correlates with neuronal activation, and is altered in neurodevelopmental
disorders. We show that in fragile X mice, S6 is regulated by ERK via the
"alternative" S6 kinase p90-ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), as evidenced by the site
of elevated phosphorylation and the finding that ERK inhibition corrects elevated
RSK and S6 activity. These findings indicate that signaling networks are altered 
in the neocortex of fragile X mice such that S6 phosphorylation receives aberrant
input from ERK/RSK. Importantly, an RSK inhibitor reduces susceptibility to
audiogenic seizures in fragile X mice. Our findings identify RSK as a therapeutic
target for fragile X and suggest the therapeutic potential of drugs for the
treatment of FXS may vary in a brain-region-specific manner.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disease. It is one of the
leading monogenic causes of intellectual disability among boys with most also
displaying autism spectrum disorder traits. Here we investigated the role of NMDA
receptors on mGluR-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD), a key biomarker in
the disease, at four different developmental stages. First, we applied the mGluR 
agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine in the absence or presence of the NMDAR
blocker, APV, hereby unmasking the NMDAR component in this process. As expected, 
in the presence of APV, we found more LTD in the mouse KO than in WT. This,
however, was only observed in the p30-60 age group. At all other age groups
tested, mGluR-LTD was almost identical between KO and WT. Interestingly, at p60, 
in the absence of APV, no or very little LTD was found in KO that was completely 
restored by application of APV. This suggests that the underlying cause of the
enhanced mGluR-LTD in KO (at p30) is caused by dysregulated NMDAR signaling. To
investigate this further, we next used NMDAR-subunit-specific antagonists.
Inhibition of GluN2B, but not GluN2A, blocked mGluR-LTD only in WT. This was in
contrast in the KO where blocking GluN2B rescued mGluR-LTD, suggesting
GluN2B-containing NMDARs in the KO are hyperactive. Thus, these findings suggest 
strong involvement of GluN2B-containing-NMDARs in the pathophysiology of FXS and 
highlight a potential path for treatment for the disease.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
There is currently no cure for fragile X, although medications targeting specific
FXS symptoms do exist. The FXS animal model, the Fmr1 knock-out mouse, has
demonstrated an increased mGluR5-mediated long-term depression (LTD) leading to
several clinical trials of mGluR5 inhibitors/modulators, yet all have failed. In 
addition, surprisingly little information exists about the possible role of other
ion channels/receptors, including NMDA receptors (NMDAR), in mGluR-LTD. Here we
focus on NMDARs and their regulation of mGluR-mediated LTD at different
developmental stages using several different NMDAR blockers/antagonists. Our
findings suggest dysregulated NMDARs in the pathophysiology of FXS leading to
altered mGluR-mediated LTD. Together, these data will help to develop new drug
candidates that could lead to reversal of the FXS phenotype.

The autism-related protein Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA 
binding protein that plays important roles during both nervous system development
and experience dependent plasticity. Alternative splicing of the Fmr1 locus gives
rise to 12 different FMRP splice forms that differ in the functional and
regulatory domains they contain as well as in their expression profile among
brain regions and across development. Complete loss of FMRP leads to
morphological and functional changes in neurons, including an increase in the
size and complexity of the axonal arbor. To investigate the relative contribution
of the FMRP splice forms to the regulation of axon morphology, we overexpressed
individual splice forms in cultured wild type rat cortical neurons. FMRP
overexpression led to a decrease in axonal arbor complexity that suggests that
FMRP regulates axon branching. This reduction in complexity was specific to three
splice forms-the full-length splice form 1, the most highly expressed splice form
7, and splice form 9. A focused analysis of splice form 7 revealed that this
regulation is independent of RNA binding. Instead this regulation is disrupted by
mutations affecting phosphorylation of a conserved serine as well as by mutating 
the nuclear export sequence. Surprisingly, this mutation in the nuclear export
sequence also led to increased localization to the distal axonal arbor. Together,
these findings reveal domain-specific functions of FMRP in the regulation of
axonal complexity that may be controlled by differential expression of FMRP
splice forms. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 77: 738-752, 2017.

Changes in insulin-like growth factor signaling alter phenotypes in Fragile X
Mice.

Wise TL(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Human Genetics, New York State Institute for Basic Research in
Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of intellectual disability that is 
usually caused by expansion of a polymorphic CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated
region of the X-linked FMR1 gene, which leads to hypermethylation and
transcriptional silencing. Two non-neurological phenotypes of FXS are enlarged
testes and connective tissue dysplasia, which could be caused by alterations in a
growth factor signaling pathway. FXS patients also frequently have autistic-like 
symptoms, suggesting that the signaling pathways affected in FXS may overlap with
those affected in autism. Identifying these pathways is important for both
understanding the effects of FMR1 inactivation and developing treatments for both
FXS and autism. Here we show that decreasing the levels of the insulin-like
growth factor (Igf) receptor 1 corrects a number of phenotypes in the mouse model
of FXS, including macro-orchidism, and that increasing the levels of IGF2
exacerbates the seizure susceptibility phenotype. These results suggest that the 
pathways altered by the loss of the FMR1-encoded protein (FMRP) may overlap with 
the pathways affected by changes in Igf signaling or that one or more of the
proteins that play a role in Igf signaling could interact with FMRP. They also
indicate a new set of potential targets for drug treatment of FXS and autism
spectrum disorders.

Caretakers and clinicians alike have long recognized that individuals with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) can have altered sensory processing, which can contribute
to its core symptoms. However, the pathobiology of sensory alterations in ASD is 
poorly understood. Here we examined nocifensive behavior in ASD mouse models, the
BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) and the fragile-X mental retardation-1 knockout (Fmr1-KO)
mice. We also examined the effects of nicotine on nocifensive behavior given that
nicotine, a nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist that has
antinociceptive effects, was shown to improve social deficits and decrease
repetitive behaviors in BTBR mice. Compared to respective controls, both BTBR and
Fmr1-KO had hyporesponsiveness to noxious thermal stimuli and electrical
stimulation of C-sensory fibers, normal responsiveness to electrical stimulation 
of Aβ- and Aδ-fiber, and hyperresponsiveness to visceral pain after acetic acid
intraperitoneal injection. In BTBR, nicotine at lower doses increased, whereas at
higher doses, it decreased hotplate latency compared to vehicle. In a
significantly different effect pattern, in control mice, nicotine had
antinociceptive effects to noxious heat only at the high dose. Interestingly,
these nocifensive behavior alterations and differential responses to nicotine
antinociceptive effects in BTBR mice were associated with significant
downregulation of α3, α4, α5, α7, β2, β3, and β4 nAChR subunits in several
cerebral regions both, during embryonic development and adulthood. Taken
together, these findings further implicate nAChRs in behaviors alterations in the
BTBR model and lend support to the hypothesis that nAChRs may be a target for
treatment of behavior deficits and sensory dysfunction in ASD.

Astrocytes are key participants in various aspects of brain development and
function, many of which are executed via secreted proteins. Defects in astrocyte 
signaling are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by
abnormal neural circuitry such as Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In animal models of
FXS, the loss in expression of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP) 
from astrocytes is associated with delayed dendrite maturation and improper
synapse formation; however, the effect of astrocyte-derived factors on the
development of neurons is not known. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an important
astrocyte-secreted protein that is involved in the regulation of spine
development and synaptogenesis. In this study, we found that cultured astrocytes 
isolated from an Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mouse model of FXS displayed a
significant decrease in TSP-1 protein expression compared to the wildtype (WT)
astrocytes. Correspondingly, Fmr1 KO hippocampal neurons exhibited morphological 
deficits in dendritic spines and alterations in excitatory synapse formation
following long-term culture. All spine and synaptic abnormalities were prevented 
in the presence of either astrocyte-conditioned media or a feeder layer derived
from FMRP-expressing astrocytes, or following the application of exogenous TSP-1.
Importantly, this work demonstrates the integral role of astrocyte-secreted
signals in the establishment of neuronal communication and identifies soluble
TSP-1 as a potential therapeutic target for Fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X is the most common monogenic disorder associated with intellectual
disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, many patients 
are afflicted with executive dysfunction, ADHD, seizure disorder and sleep
disturbances. Fragile X is caused by loss of FMRP expression, which is encoded by
the FMR1 gene. Both the fly and mouse models of fragile X are also based on
having no functional protein expression of their respective FMR1 homologs. The
fly model displays well defined cognitive impairments and structural brain
defects and the mouse model, although having subtle behavioral defects, has
robust electrophysiological phenotypes and provides a tool to do extensive
biochemical analysis of select brain regions. Decreased cAMP signaling has been
observed in samples from the fly and mouse models of fragile X as well as in
samples derived from human patients. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that
strategies that increase cAMP signaling can rescue short term memory in the fly
model and restore DHPG induced mGluR mediated long term depression (LTD) in the
hippocampus to proper levels in the mouse model (McBride et al., 2005; Choi et
al., 2011, 2015). Here, we demonstrate that the same three strategies used
previously with the potential to be used clinically, lithium treatment, PDE-4
inhibitor treatment or mGluR antagonist treatment can rescue long term memory in 
the fly model and alter the cAMP signaling pathway in the hippocampus of the
mouse model.

Human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide unique
opportunities for disease modeling and drug development. However, adapting hiPSCs
or their differentiated progenies to high throughput assays for phenotyping or
drug screening has been challenging. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common 
inherited cause of intellectual disability and a major genetic cause of autism.
FXS is caused by mutational trinucleotide expansion in the FMR1 gene leading to
hypermethylation and gene silencing. One potential therapeutic strategy is to
reactivate the silenced FMR1 gene, which has been attempted using both candidate 
chemicals and cell-based screening. However, molecules that effectively
reactivate the silenced FMR1 gene are yet to be identified; therefore, a high
throughput unbiased screen is needed. Here we demonstrate the creation of a
robust FMR1-Nluc reporter hiPSC line by knocking in a Nano luciferase (Nluc) gene
into the endogenous human FMR1 gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method. 
We confirmed that luciferase activities faithfully report FMR1 gene expression
levels and showed that neural progenitor cells derived from this line could be
optimized for high throughput screening. The FMR1-Nluc reporter line is a good
resource for drug screening as well as for testing potential genetic reactivation
strategies. In addition, our data provide valuable information for the generation
of knockin human iPSC reporter lines for disease modeling, drug screening, and
mechanistic studies. Stem Cells 2017;35:158-169.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to review the typical cognitive and motor
impairments seen in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS),
essential tremor (ET), Parkinson disease (PD), spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs),
multiple system atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in order 
to enhance diagnosis of FXTAS patients.
METHODS: We compared the cognitive and motor phenotypes of FXTAS with each of
these other movement disorders. Relevant neuropathological and neuroimaging
findings are also reviewed. Finally, we describe the differences in age of onset,
disease severity, progression rates, and average lifespan in FXTAS compared to
ET, PD, SCAs, MSA, and PSP. We conclude with a flow chart algorithm to guide the 
clinician in the differential diagnosis of FXTAS.
RESULTS: By comparing the cognitive and motor phenotypes of FXTAS with the
phenotypes of ET, PD, SCAs, MSA, and PSP we have clarified potential symptom
overlap while elucidating factors that make these disorders unique from one
another. In summary, the clinician should consider a FXTAS diagnosis and testing 
for the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene premutation if a patient over 
the age of 50 (1) presents with cerebellar ataxia and/or intention tremor with
mild parkinsonism, (2) has the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) sign, global
cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, and/or subcortical white matter lesions on MRI, 
or (3) has a family history of fragile X related disorders, intellectual
disability, autism, premature ovarian failure and has neurological signs
consistent with FXTAS. Peripheral neuropathy, executive function deficits,
anxiety, or depression are supportive of the diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Distinct profiles in the cognitive and motor domains between these
movement disorders may guide practitioners in the differential diagnosis process 
and ultimately lead to better medical management of FXTAS patients.

How the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in different brain
cell types, especially in non-neuron glial cells, induces fragile X syndrome
(FXS) phenotypes has just begun to be understood. In the current study, we
generated inducible astrocyte-specific Fmr1 conditional knock-out mice
(i-astro-Fmr1-cKO) and restoration mice (i-astro-Fmr1-cON) to study the in vivo
modulation of FXS synaptic phenotypes by astroglial FMRP. We found that
functional expression of glutamate transporter GLT1 is 40% decreased in
i-astro-Fmr1-cKO somatosensory cortical astrocytes in vivo, which can be fully
rescued by the selective re-expression of FMRP in astrocytes in i-astro-Fmr1-cON 
mice. Although the selective loss of astroglial FMRP only modestly increases
spine density and length in cortical pyramidal neurons, selective re-expression
of FMRP in astrocytes significantly attenuates abnormal spine morphology in these
neurons of i-astro-Fmr1-cON mice. Moreover, we found that basal protein synthesis
levels and immunoreactivity of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (p-s6P) is
significantly increased in i-astro-Fmr1-cKO mice, while the enhanced cortical
protein synthesis observed in Fmr1 KO mice is mitigated in i-astro-Fmr1-cON mice.
Furthermore, ceftriaxone-mediated upregulation of surface GLT1 expression
restores functional glutamate uptake and attenuates enhanced neuronal
excitability in Fmr1 KO mice. In particular, ceftriaxone significantly decreases 
the growth rate of abnormally accelerated body weight and completely corrects
spine abnormality in Fmr1 KO mice. Together, these results show that the
selective loss of astroglial FMRP contributes to cortical synaptic deficits in
FXS, presumably through dysregulated astroglial glutamate transporter GLT1 and
impaired glutamate uptake. These results suggest the involvement of
astrocyte-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of FXS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
Previous studies to understand how the loss of function of fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome (FXS) have largely focused
on neurons; whether the selective loss of astroglial FMRP in vivo alters
astrocyte functions and contributes to the pathogenesis of FXS remain essentially
unknown. This has become a long-standing unanswered question in the fragile X
field, which is also relevant to autism pathogenesis. Our current study generated
astrocyte-specific Fmr1 conditional knock-out and restoration mice, and provided 
compelling evidence that the selective loss of astroglial FMRP contributes to
cortical synaptic deficits in FXS, likely through the dysregulated astroglial
glutamate transporter GLT1 expression and impaired glutamate uptake. These
results demonstrate previously undescribed astrocyte-mediated mechanisms in the
pathogenesis of FXS.

Dynamic changes in synaptic strength rely on de novo protein synthesis and
protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Disruption of
either of these cellular processes will result in significant impairments in
synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Mutations in several genes encoding
regulators of mRNA translation and members of the UPS have been associated with
an increased risk for the development of autism spectrum disorders. It is
possible that these mutations result in a similar imbalance in protein
homeostasis (proteostasis) at the synapse. This review will summarize recent work
investigating the role of the UPS in synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic
synapses, and propose that dysfunctional proteostasis is a common consequence of 
several genetic mutations linked to autism spectrum disorders. Dynamic changes in
synaptic strength rely on de novo protein synthesis and protein degradation by
the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Disruption of either of these cellular
processes will result in significant impairments in synaptic plasticity and
memory formation. Mutations in several genes encoding regulators of mRNA
translation (i.e. FMR1) and protein degradation (i.e. UBE3A) have been associated
with an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability 
(ASD/ID). These mutations similarly disrupt protein homeostasis (proteostasis).
Compensatory changes that reset the rate of proteostasis may contribute to the
neurological symptoms of ASD/ID. This review summarizes recent work investigating
the role of the UPS in synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses, and
proposes that dysfunctional proteostasis is a common consequence of several
genetic mutations linked to ASD. This article is part of a mini review series:

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and predictors of subjective memory
complaints among a cohort of male FMR1 premutation (PM) carriers with and without
fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
METHOD: Twenty-two PM males (ages 26-80, 7 with FXTAS) and 24 matched controls
with normal FMR1 alleles (ages 26-77) completed cross-sectional assessments of
subjective memory complaints (memory complaints questionnaire, MAC-Q), objective 
memory function (Logical Memory subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale, third
edition), and psychiatric symptoms (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales; the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders).
RESULTS: Although a greater proportion of PM males (36%) endorsed subjective
memory complaints compared to controls (21%), formal statistical comparisons
failed to reach significance. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that
subjective memory complaints were not associated with objective memory
performance, but rather were predicted by elevated psychiatric symptoms. The
relationship between psychiatric symptoms and subjective complaints found in the 
PM group was not statistically different to that found in the control group.
There were no significant relationships between FMR1 molecular measures (CGG
repeat length, FMR1 mRNA level) and measures of subjective memory complaints,
objective memory performance, or psychiatric symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: In keeping with findings from the general population, this study
suggests that subjective ratings of memory performance in PM males are associated
with underlying psychological factors rather than cross-sectional objective
memory function. However, future longitudinal studies are required to determine
whether subjective memory complaints may predict changes in objective memory
function over time.

Neuropsychiatry of fragile X-premutation carriers with and without fragile
X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome: implications for neuropsychology.

Bourgeois JA(1).

Author information: 
(1)a Department of Psychiatry , University of California San Francisco School of 
Medicine , San Francisco , CA , USA.

OBJECTIVES: Clinical neuropsychologists benefit from clinical currency in
recently ascertained neuropsychiatric illness, such as fragile X premutation
(FXPM) disorders. The author reviewed the clinical literature through 2016 for
neuropsychiatric phenotypes in FXPM disorders, including patients with fragile
X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
METHODS: A PubMed search using the search terms 'Fragile X,' 'Premutation,'
'Carriers,' 'Psychiatric,' 'Dementia,' 'Mood,' and 'Anxiety' for citations in the
clinical literature through 2016 was reviewed for studies specifically examining 
the neuropsychiatric phenotype in FXPM patients. The relevant articles were
classified according to specific neuropsychiatric syndromes, including child
onset, adult onset with and without FXTAS, as well as common systemic
comorbidities in FXPM patients.
RESULTS: Eighty-six articles were reviewed for the neuropsychiatric and other
phenotypes in FXPM patients. The neuropsychiatric phenotype in FXPM patients is
distinct from that of full mutation (Fragile X Syndrome) patients. FXTAS is
associated with a specific cortical-subcortical major or mild neurocognitive
disorder (NCD).
CONCLUSIONS: FXPM patients are at risk for neuropsychiatric illness. In addition,
FXPM patients are at risk for other systemic conditions that should raise
suspicion for FXPM-associated illnesses. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis
of FXPM-associated neuropsychiatric illness when patients with specific clinical 
scenarios are encountered; especially in patient pedigrees consistent with a
typical (often multigenerational) presentation of fragile X-associated
conditions, confirmatory genetic testing should be considered. Clinical
management should take into account the psychological challenges of a
multigenerational genetic neuropsychiatric illness with a variable CNS and
systemic clinical phenotype.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical observations and a limited number of research studies provide
evidence that the fragile X premutation may confer risk for autism, executive
dysfunction, and psychopathology. The link to autism spectrum symptoms and social
cognition deficits with the premutation remains uncertain, and thus was the focus
of the present investigation.
METHOD: Our sample included 131 individuals, 42 men/22 women with the FMR1
premutation (mean age = 31.83 ± 8.59 years) with a normal neurological exam, and 
48 men/19 women healthy age-matched controls (mean age = 29.48 ± 7.29 years).
Individuals completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery with additional 
assessments for social cognition, broad autism spectrum, and obsessive-compulsive
(OC) symptoms.
RESULTS: Premutation carriers self-reported higher rates of autism-related
symptoms (Autism Quotient; p = .001). Among males only, premutation carriers
showed more atypical social interaction (p < .001) and stereotyped behavior
(p = .014) during standardized clinical examination on the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule (ADOS) relative to controls. Female premutation carriers
reported significantly higher rates of OC symptoms compared to control females
(p = .012). Molecular measures defining the expanded premutation (FMR1 CGG repeat
length and/or mRNA) were significantly associated with a measure of theory of
mind (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a higher rate of broad autism
spectrum symptoms in some males with the premutation and provide evidence for an 
obsessive-compulsive subtype in female premutation carriers.

OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychologists have an important role in evaluating patients with 
fragile X-associated disorders, but most practitioners are unaware of the
recently identified neurodegenerative movement disorder known as fragile
X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The objective of this editorial is
to orient the reader to FXTAS and highlight the importance of clinical
neuropsychology in describing the fragile X premutation phenotype and the role
practitioners may have in assessing and monitoring patients with or at risk for
neurodegeneration.
METHOD: We issued a call for papers for the special issue, highlighting the
primary objective of familiarizing clinical neuropsychologists with FXTAS, and
with the neuropsychological phenotype of both male and female asymptomatic
carriers.
RESULTS: Eight papers are included, including an overview of the fragile
X-associated disorders (Grigsby), a review of the neuroradiological and
neurological aspects of FXTAS and how the disorder compares to other movement
disorders (O'Keefe et al.), a perspective on the prominence of white matter
disease and dementia in FXTAS (Filley), and a review of mouse models of FXTAS
(Foote). There are four research papers, including one on self-reported memory
problems in FXTAS (Birch et al.), and three papers focused on the
neuropsychiatric aspects of the fragile X premutation, a review (Bourgeois), an
examination of autism-related traits (Schneider), and a research paper on
executive functioning and psychopathology (Grigsby).
CONCLUSIONS: The issue highlights the importance of awareness of fragile
X-associated disorders for neuropsychologists, an awareness that must reach
beyond neurodevelopmental aspects related to fragile X syndrome into the realm of
neurodegenerative disease and aging.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability (ID) and co-morbid autism. It is caused by an amplification of the CGG
repeat (>200), which is known as the full mutation, within the 5'UTR of the FMR1 
gene. Expansions between 55-200 CGG repeats are termed premutation and are
associated with a greater risk for fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
and fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency. Intermediate alleles,
also called the grey zone, include approximately 45-54 repeats and are considered
borderline. Individuals with less than 45 repeats have a normal FMR1 gene. We
report the occurrence of CGG expansions of the FMR1 gene in Chile among patients 
with ID and families with a known history of FXS. Here, we present a
retrospective review conducted on 2321 cases (2202 probands and 119 relatives)
referred for FXS diagnosis and cascade screening at the Institute of Nutrition
and Food Technology (INTA), University of Chile. Samples were analysed using
traditional cytogenetic methods and/or PCR. Southern blot was used to confirm the
diagnosis. Overall frequency of FMR1 expansions observed among probands was 194
(8·8%), the average age of diagnosis was 8·8 ± 5·4 years. Of 119 family members
studied, 72 (60%) were diagnosed with a CGG expansion. Our results indicated that
the prevalence of CGG expansions of the FMR1 gene among probands is relatively
higher than other populations. The average age of diagnosis is also higher than
reference values. PCR and Southern blot represent a reliable molecular technique 
in the diagnosis of FXS.

Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and the leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS is
caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (Fmr1) 
gene due to a CGG repeat expansion, resulting in the loss of Fragile X Mental
Retardation Protein (FMRP). FMRP is involved in transcriptional regulation and
trafficking of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and distal sites both in
pre- and post-synaptic terminals. Consequently, FXS is a multifaceted disorder
associated with impaired synaptic plasticity. One region of the brain that is
significantly impacted by the loss of FMRP is the hippocampus, a structure that
plays a critical role in the regulation of mood and cognition. This review
provides an overview of the neuropathology of Fragile-X Syndrome, highlighting
how structural and synaptic deficits in hippocampal subregions, including the CA1
exhibiting exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor dependent long-term
depression and the dentate gyrus displaying hypofunction of N-methyl-d-aspartate 
receptors, contribute to cognitive impairments associated with this
neurodevelopmental disorder.

The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of
variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of
environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal 
paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive 
behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive
efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and
functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In
this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in
Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple
autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with
diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral
inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning
defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to
activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. 
Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging
function for autism-risk genes.

It is now recognized that FMR1 premutation carriers (PC) are at risk to develop a
range of neurological, psychiatric, and immune-mediated disorders during
adulthood. There are conflicting findings regarding the incidence of
hypertension, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and cancer in these patients that warrant
further study. A retrospective controlled study was performed in a convenience
sample of 248 controls (130 men, 118 women) and 397 FMR1 PC with and without
fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) (176 men, 221 women); all
participants were at least 45 years old (men: mean 62.4, SD 9.5; women: mean
62.8, SD 9.9; p = 0.63). Memory and cognitive assessments (Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III)) and molecular
testing (CGG repeats and FMR1-mRNA levels) were performed. Additional data
included body mass index (BMI), cholesterol levels, blood pressure, hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) levels, and medical history. A higher percentage of PC subjects
self-reported having a diagnosis of hypertension (50.0 vs. 35.0 %, p = 0.006) and
thyroid problems (20.4 vs. 10.0 %, p = 0.012) than control subjects. When
comparing controls versus PC with FXTAS, the association was higher for diabetes 
(p = 0.043); however, the effect was not significant after adjusting for
demographic predictors. Blood pressure, blood glucose levels, HbA1c, and BMI
values were not significantly different between the two groups. The PC with FXTAS
group performed consistently lower in neuropsychological testing compared with
the PC without FXTAS group, but the differences were very small for all but the
WAIS full-scale IQ. Based on these findings, it appears that the risk for
hypertension, thyroid problems, and diabetes may be more frequent in PC with
FXTAS, which will require verification in future studies.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent known genetically inherited cause 
for autism and intellectual disability. Premutation state can cause several
clinical disorders as well. We aimed to perform a nesting approach to acquire
data with regard to first degree relatives of index fragile X cases at the
largest child development center in Israel in order to map characteristics of
Israeli FXS permutation women carriers. Seventy-nine women were referred due to a
related fragile X syndrome patient, mainly an offspring or sibling. General
information regarding demographics, ethnicity, and associated medical conditions 
were collected using interviews and structured questionnaires. Thirteen (17 %) of
the women who were referred as "carrier" were proven to be actually full
mutation. The mean years of education were 14 (±1.51, range 12-17). Twenty-one
women (27 %) originated from Tunisia (mainly from the island of Djerba). Ten
women (13 %) reported delivery of their affected offspring beyond 41 gestational 
weeks. Twenty-two percent of women with premutation reported symptoms consistent 
with learning difficulties, mainly dyscalculia, and 14 % reported ADHD symptoms. 
Awareness about clinical disorders of the carriers was existent only in 25 % of
the patients. Increased awareness and knowledge dissemination concerning
premutation symptomatology and associated medical conditions are warranted. We
suggest a national registry to be installed in different countries in order to
identify fragile X premutation carriers at increased risk for various medical
complications.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly inherited form of intellectual
disability and is a disorder that is also highly associated with autism. FXS
occurs as a result of an expanded CGG repeat sequence leading to transcriptional 
silencing. In an animal model of FXS in which Fmr1 is knocked out (Fmr1 KO), many
physical, physiological, and behavioral characteristics of the human disease are 
recapitulated. Prior characterization of the mouse model was conducted during the
day, the inactive phase of the circadian cycle. Circadian rhythms are an
important contributor to behavior and may play a role in the study of disease
phenotype. Moreover, changes in the parameters of circadian rhythm are known to
occur in FXS animal models. We conducted an investigation of key behavioral
phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice during their active phase. We report that phase did
not alter the Fmr1 KO phenotype in open field activity, anxiety, and learning and
memory. There was a slight effect of phase on social behavior as measured by time
in chamber, but not by time spent sniffing. Our data strengthen the existing data
characterizing the phenotype of Fmr1 KO mice, indicating that it is independent
of circadian phase.

Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) commonly experience aberrant
tactile sensitivity, yet the neural alterations underlying somatosensory
dysfunction and the extent to which tactile deficits contribute to ASD
characteristics are unknown. We report that mice harboring mutations in Mecp2,
Gabrb3, Shank3, and Fmr1 genes associated with ASDs in humans exhibit altered
tactile discrimination and hypersensitivity to gentle touch. Deletion of Mecp2 or
Gabrb3 in peripheral somatosensory neurons causes mechanosensory dysfunction
through loss of GABAA receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of inputs to the
CNS. Remarkably, tactile defects resulting from Mecp2 or Gabrb3 deletion in
somatosensory neurons during development, but not in adulthood, cause social
interaction deficits and anxiety-like behavior. Restoring Mecp2 expression
exclusively in the somatosensory neurons of Mecp2-null mice rescues tactile
sensitivity, anxiety-like behavior, and social interaction deficits, but not
lethality, memory, or motor deficits. Thus, mechanosensory processing defects
contribute to anxiety-like behavior and social interaction deficits in ASD mouse 
models. PAPERCLIP.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder caused by a repeat expansion in the fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The disorder is characterized by kinetic tremor and
cerebellar ataxia, shows age-dependent penetrance, and occurs more frequently in 
men. This paper summarizes the key emerging issues in FXTAS as presented at the
Second International Conference on the FMR1 Premutation: Basic Mechanisms &
Clinical Involvement in 2015. The topics discussed include phenotype-genotype
relationships, neurobehavioral function, and updates on FXTAS genetics and
imaging.

Epigenetic silencing of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) causes fragile X
syndrome (FXS), a common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism.
FXS correlates with abnormal synapse and dendritic spine development, but the
molecular link between the absence of the FMR1 product FMRP, an RNA binding
protein, and the neuropathology is unclear. We found that the messenger RNA
encoding bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2) is a target of FMRP.
Depletion of FMRP increased BMPR2 abundance, especially that of the full-length
isoform that bound and activated LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), a component of the 
noncanonical BMP signal transduction pathway that stimulates actin reorganization
to promote neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Heterozygosity for BMPR2
rescued the morphological abnormalities in neurons both in Drosophila and in
mouse models of FXS, as did the postnatal pharmacological inhibition of LIMK1
activity. Compared with postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue from healthy
subjects, the amount of full-length BMPR2 and of a marker of LIMK1 activity was
increased in this brain region from FXS patients. These findings suggest that
increased BMPR2 signal transduction is linked to FXS and that the BMPR2-LIMK1
pathway is a putative therapeutic target in patients with FXS and possibly other 
forms of autism.

The role of post-transcriptional gene regulation in human brain development and
neurodevelopmental disorders remains mostly uncharacterized. ELAV-like
RNA-binding proteins (RNAbps) are a family of proteins that regulate several
aspects of neuronal function including neuronal excitability and synaptic
transmission, both critical to the normal function of the brain in cognition and 
behavior. Here, we identify the downstream neuronal transcriptional and splicing 
networks of ELAVL2, an RNAbp with previously unknown function in the brain.
Expression of ELAVL2 was reduced in human neurons and RNA-sequencing was utilized
to identify networks of differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes 
resulting from haploinsufficient levels of ELAVL2. These networks contain a
number of autism-relevant genes as well as previously identified targets of other
important RNAbps implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including RBFOX1
and FMRP. ELAVL2-regulated co-expression networks are also enriched for
neurodevelopmental and synaptic genes, and include genes with human-specific
patterns of expression in the frontal pole. Together, these data suggest that
ELAVL2 regulation of transcript expression is critical for neuronal function and 
clinically relevant to ASD.

Dendritic spine generation and elimination play an important role in learning and
memory, the dynamics of which have been examined within the neocortex in vivo.
Spine turnover has also been detected in the absence of specific learning tasks, 
and is frequently exaggerated in animal models of autistic spectrum disorder
(ASD). The present study aimed to examine whether the baseline rate of spine
turnover was activity-dependent. This was achieved using a microfluidic brain
interface and open-dura surgery, with the goal of abolishing neuronal Ca(2+)
signaling in the visual cortex of wild-type mice and rodent models of fragile X
syndrome (Fmr1 knockout [KO]). In wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice, the majority of
baseline turnover was found to be activity-independent. Accordingly, the
application of matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibitors selectively restored the
abnormal spine dynamics observed in Fmr1 KO mice, without affecting the intrinsic
dynamics of spine turnover in wild-type mice. Such findings indicate that the
baseline turnover of dendritic spines is mediated by activity-independent
intrinsic dynamics. Furthermore, these results suggest that the targeting of
abnormal intrinsic dynamics might pose a novel therapy for ASD.

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects many children and juveniles.
The pathogenesis of ASD is not well understood. Environmental factors may play
important roles in the development of ASD. We examined a possible relationship of
inflammatory pain in neonates and the development of ASD in juveniles.
METHODS: Acute inflammation pain was induced by 5 % formalin (5 μl/day)
subcutaneous injection into two hindpaws of postnatal day 3 to 5 (P3-P5) rat
pups. Western blot, immunohistochemical, and behavioral examinations were
performed at different time points after the insult.
RESULTS: Formalin injection caused acute and chronic inflammatory responses
including transient local edema, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines,
TNF-α, and IL-1β in the blood as well as in the brain, and increased microglia in
the brain. One day after the pain insult, there was significant cell death in the
cortex and hippocampus. Two weeks later, although the hindpaw local reaction
subsided, impaired axonal growth and demyelization were seen in the brain of P21 
juvenile rats. The number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and doublecortin (DCX)
double-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of P21 rats was
significantly lower than that in controls, indicating reduced neurogenesis. In
the P21 rat's brain of the formalin group, the expression of autism-related gene 
neurexin 1 (NRXN1), fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1), and oxytocin was
significantly downregulated, consistent with the gene alteration in ASD. Juvenile
rats in the formalin group showed hyperalgesia, repetitive behaviors, abnormal
locomotion, sleep disorder, and distinct deficits in social memory and social
activities. These alterations in neuroinflammatory reactions, gene expression,
and behaviors were more evident in male than in female rats. Importantly, an
anti-inflammation treatment using indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) at the time of
formalin injections suppressed inflammatory responses and neuronal cell death and
prevented alterations in ASD-related genes and the development of abnormal
behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: These novel observations indicate that severe inflammatory pain in
neonates and persistent inflammatory reactions may predispose premature infants
to development delays and psychiatric disorders including ASD. The prevention of 
pain stimuli and prompt treatments of inflammation during development appear
vitally important in disrupting possible evolution of ASD syndromes.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading form of inherited intellectual
disability. It is caused by the transcriptional silencing of FMR1, the gene which
codes for the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Patients who have FXS 
exhibit numerous behavioral and cognitive impairments, such as
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and
autistic-like behaviors. In addition to these behavioral abnormalities, FXS
patients have also been shown to exhibit various deficits in communication such
as abnormal sentence structures, increased utterances, repetition of sounds and
words, and reduced articulation. These deficits can dramatically hinder
communication for FXS patients, exacerbating learning and cognition impairments
while decreasing their quality of life. To examine the biological underpinnings
of these communication abnormalities, studies have used a mouse model of the
Fragile X Syndrome; however, these vocalization studies have resulted in
inconsistent findings that often do not correlate with abnormalities observed in 
FXS patients. Interestingly, a detailed examination of frequency modulated
vocalizations that are believed to be a better assessment of rodent communication
has never been conducted. The following study used courtship separation to
conduct a detailed examination of frequency modulated ultrasonic vocalizations
(USV) in FXS mice. Our analyses of frequency modulated USVs demonstrated that
adult FXS mice exhibited longer phrases and more motifs. Phrases are
vocalizations consisting of multiple frequency modulated ultrasonic
vocalizations, while motifs are repeated frequency modulated USV patterns.
Fragile X mice had a higher proportion of "u" syllables in all USVs and phrases
while their wildtype counterparts preferred isolated "h" syllables. Although the 
specific importance of these syllables towards communication deficits still needs
to be evaluated, these findings in production of USVs are consistent with the
repetitive and perseverative speech patterns observed in FXS patients. This study
demonstrates that FXS mice can be used to study the underlying biological
mechanism(s) mediating FXS vocalization abnormalities.

The biological effects of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) have
been widely studied. Dysregulation of miRNAs plays a critical role in the
progression of nervous system diseases and in cell proliferation and
differentiation. Our previous study validated that miR-19b-3p was associated with
FXR1 (Fragile X related gene 1), one of homologous genes of FMR1 (Fragile X
mental retardation 1). The purpose of this study was to investigate the
relationship of FXR1 and miR-19b-3p, and the crucial role of miR-19b-3p in FXS
and to validate whether miR-19b-3p could regulate the growth of SH-SY5Y cells. We
determined that miR-19b-3p could regulate the expression of not only USP32, RAB18
and Dusp6 but also FXR1, and FXR1 could in turn regulate the expression of
miR-19b-3p. What's more, the overexpression of miR-19b-3p significantly inhibited
the proliferation, contributed the apoptosis and slowed down the cycle of SH-SY5Y
cells. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-19b-3p plays a significant
role in the molecular pathology of FXS by interacting with FXR1 and influencing
the growth of SH-SY5Y cells.

There is now growing evidence of cognitive weakness in female premutation
carriers (between 55 and 199 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation
gene, including impairments associated with executive function. While an
age-related decline in assessments of executive function has been found for male 
premutation carriers, few studies have explored whether female carriers show a
similar trajectory with age. A total of 20 female premutation carriers and 21
age- and IQ-matched healthy controls completed a battery of tasks assessing
executive function tasks, including the behavioural dyscontrol scale (BDS),
symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT),
Haylings sentence completion test and the digit span task (forward and backward).
Performance was compared between premutation carriers and healthy controls, and
the association between task performance and age was also ascertained. Compared
to controls, female premutation carriers had significant impairment on the BDS,
SDMT, PASAT, and Haylings sentence completion task, all of which rely on quick,
or timed, responses. Further analyses revealed no significant association between
age and task performance for either premutation carriers or controls. This study 
demonstrates that a cohort of female premutation carriers have deficits on a
range of tasks of executive function that require the rapid temporal resolution
of responses. We propose that the understanding of the phenotype of premutation
carriers will be advanced through use of such measures.

Comment in
    JAMA Psychiatry. 2016 Jun 1;73(6):553-4.

IMPORTANCE: Complex disorders, such as bipolar disorder (BD), likely result from 
the influence of both common and rare susceptibility alleles. While common
variation has been widely studied, rare variant discovery has only recently
become feasible with next-generation sequencing.
OBJECTIVE: To utilize a combined family-based and case-control approach to exome 
sequencing in BD using multiplex families as an initial discovery strategy,
followed by association testing in a large case-control meta-analysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed exome sequencing of 36 affected
members with BD from 8 multiplex families and tested rare, segregating variants
in 3 independent case-control samples consisting of 3541 BD cases and 4774
controls.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used penalized logistic regression and 1-sided
gene-burden analyses to test for association of rare, segregating damaging
variants with BD. Permutation-based analyses were performed to test for overall
enrichment with previously identified gene sets.
RESULTS: We found 84 rare (frequency <1%), segregating variants that were
bioinformatically predicted to be damaging. These variants were found in 82 genes
that were enriched for gene sets previously identified in de novo studies of
autism (19 observed vs. 10.9 expected, P = .0066) and schizophrenia (11 observed 
vs. 5.1 expected, P = .0062) and for targets of the fragile X mental retardation 
protein (FMRP) pathway (10 observed vs. 4.4 expected, P = .0076). The
case-control meta-analyses yielded 19 genes that were nominally associated with
BD based either on individual variants or a gene-burden approach. Although no
gene was individually significant after correction for multiple testing, this
group of genes continued to show evidence for significant enrichment of de novo
autism genes (6 observed vs 2.6 expected, P = .028).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results are consistent with the presence of
prominent locus and allelic heterogeneity in BD and suggest that very large
samples will be required to definitively identify individual rare variants or
genes conferring risk for this disorder. However, we also identify significant
associations with gene sets composed of previously discovered de novo variants in
autism and schizophrenia, as well as targets of the FRMP pathway, providing
preliminary support for the overlap of potential autism and schizophrenia risk
genes with rare, segregating variants in families with BD.

Behavioral symptoms and traits have been proposed as early markers in
neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate social anxiety 
and autism in FMR1 premutation carriers using the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) 
and the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaires. Fifty-nine premutation
carriers were compared with 50 controls. The SPIN test showed statistically
significant differences between female but not male carriers. The AQ
questionnaire found statistically significant differences between premutation
carriers and controls in the total AQ as well as in the social skills and
attention switching subdomains. A gender effect was only observed for the social 
skills subdomain. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a moderately positive 
correlation with the total AQ scores as well as the social skills and
communication subdomains. Our results show that fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) patients have higher AQ scores. Moreover, this is 
the first study to find statistically significant differences between FXTAS and
no-FXTAS premutation carriers in the communication and the imagination
subdomains, suggesting that FXTAS patients present a broader autistic phenotype
than premutation carriers without FXTAS. Based on our results, a wide range of
behavioral/psychiatric traits should be included within the broader phenotypic
presentation of individuals with the FMR1 premutation.

Sensory hypersensitivities are common, clinically distressing features of Fragile
X Syndrome (FXS). Preclinical evidence suggests this abnormality may result from 
synaptic hyper-excitability in sensory systems. This model predicts reduced
sensory habituation to repeated stimulus presentation. Fourteen adolescents and
adults with FXS and 15 age-matched controls participated in a modified auditory
gating task using trains of 4 identical tones during dense array
electroencephalography (EEG). Event-related potential and single trial
time-frequency analyses revealed decreased habituation of the N1 event-related
potential response in FXS, and increased gamma power coupled with decreases in
gamma phase-locking during the early-stimulus registration period. EEG
abnormalities in FXS were associated with parent reports of heightened sensory
sensitivities and social communication deficits. Reduced habituation and altered 
gamma power and phase-locking to auditory cues demonstrated here in FXS patients 
parallels preclinical findings with Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, the EEG abnormalities
seen in FXS patients support the model of neocortical hyper-excitability in FXS, 
and may provide useful translational biomarkers for evaluating novel treatment
strategies targeting its neural substrate.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an undertreated neurodevelopmental disorder
characterized by low intelligence quotent and a wide range of other symptoms
including disordered sleep and autism. Although FXS is the most prevalent
inherited cause of intellectual disability, its mechanistic underpinnings are not
well understood. Using Drosophila as a model of FXS, we showed that select
expression of dfmr1 in the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) of the brain was
sufficient to restore normal circadian behavior and to rescue the memory deficits
in the fragile X mutant fly. Examination of the insulin signaling (IS) pathway
revealed elevated levels of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (Dilp2) in the IPCs
and elevated IS in the dfmr1 mutant brain. Consistent with a causal role for
elevated IS in dfmr1 mutant phenotypes, the expression of dfmr1 specifically in
the IPCs reduced IS, and genetic reduction of the insulin pathway also led to
amelioration of circadian and memory defects. Furthermore, we showed that
treatment with the FDA-approved drug metformin also rescued memory. Finally, we
showed that reduction of IS is required at different time points to rescue
circadian behavior and memory. Our results indicate that insulin misregulation
underlies the circadian and cognitive phenotypes displayed by the Drosophila
fragile X model, and thus reveal a metabolic pathway that can be targeted by new 
and already approved drugs to treat fragile X patients.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late onset
neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by tremors, ataxia, impaired
coordination, and cognitive decline. While all FXTAS individuals are carriers of 
a 55-200 CGG expansion at the 5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation gene
(FMR1), also known as premutation, not all carriers develop FXTAS symptoms and
some display other types of psychological/emotional disorders (e.g., autism,
anxiety). The goal of this study was to investigate whether the mitochondrial
dysfunction previously observed in fibroblasts from older premutation individuals
(>60 years) was already present in younger (17-48 years), non-FXTAS-affected
carriers and to identify the type and severity of the bioenergetic deficit. Since
FXTAS affects mostly males, while females account for a small part of the
FXTAS-affected population displaying less severe symptoms, only fibroblasts from 
males were evaluated in this study. Based on polarographic and enzymatic
measurements, a generalized OXPHOS deficit was noted accompanied by increases in 
the matrix biomarker citrate synthase, oxidative stress (as increased mtDNA copy 
number and deletions), and mitochondrial network disruption/disorganization. Some
of the outcomes (ATP-linked oxygen uptake, coupling, citrate synthase activity,
and mitochondrial network organization) strongly correlated with the extent of
the CGG expansion, with more severe deficits observed in cell lines carrying
higher CGG number. Furthermore, mitochondrial outcomes can identify
endophenotypes among carriers and are robust predictors of the premutation
diagnosis before the onset of FXTAS, with the potential to be used as markers of 
prognosis and/or as readouts of pharmacological interventions.

Triplet repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause
either intellectual disability and autism, or adult-onset neurodegeneration, with
poorly understood variability in presentation. Previous studies have identified
several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) at the FMR1 locus, including FMR4.
Similarly to FMR1, FMR4 is silenced by large-repeat expansions that result in
enrichment of DNA and histone methylation within the shared promoter and repeat
sequence, suggesting a possible role for this noncoding RNA in the
pathophysiology of Fragile X. We therefore assessed the functional role of FMR4
to gain further insight into the molecular processes in Fragile X-associated
disorders. Previous work showed that FMR4 does not exhibit cis-regulation of
FMR1. Here, we found that FMR4 is a chromatin-associated transcript and, using
genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, showed that FMR4 alters
the chromatin state and the expression of several hundred genes in trans. Among
the genes regulated by FMR4, we found enrichment for those involved in neural
development and cellular proliferation. S-phase marker assays further
demonstrated that FMR4 may promote cellular proliferation, rather than
differentiation, of human neural precursor cells (hNPCs). By establishing this
novel function for FMR4 in hNPCs, we lend support to existing evidence of the
epigenetic involvement of lncRNA in nervous system development, and increase our 
understanding of the complex pathogenesis underlying neurological disorders
associated with FMR1 repeat expansions.

Previous studies attempting to quantify white matter (WM) microstructure in
individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) have produced inconsistent findings,
most likely due to the various control groups employed, differing analysis
methods, and failure to examine for potential motion artifact. In addition,
analyses have heretofore lacked sufficient specificity to provide regional
information. In this study, we used Automated Fiber-tract Quantification (AFQ) to
identify specific regions of aberrant WM microstructure along WM tracts in
patients with FXS that differed from controls who were matched on age, IQ and
degree of autistic symptoms. Participants were 20 patients with FXS, aged 10 to
23 years, and 20 matched controls. Using Automated Fiber-tract Quantification
(AFQ), we created Tract Profiles of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity
along 18 major WM fascicles. We found that fractional anisotropy was
significantly increased in the left and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus
(ILF), right uncinate fasciculus, and left cingulum hippocampus in individuals
with FXS compared to controls. Conversely, mean diffusivity was significantly
decreased in the right ILF in patients with FXS compared to controls. Age was
significantly negatively associated with MD values across both groups in 11
tracts. Taken together, these findings indicate that FXS results in abnormal WM
microstructure in specific regions of the ILF and uncinate fasciculus, most
likely caused by inefficient synaptic pruning as a result of decreased or absent 
Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Longitudinal studies are needed to
confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder that is the most
common heritable cause of intellectual disability and the most frequent monogenic
cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). FXS is caused by an expansion of
trinucleotide repeats in the promoter region of the fragile X mental retardation 
gene (Fmr1). This leads to a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP),
which regulates translation of a wide range of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The extent
of expression level alterations of synaptic proteins affected by FMRP loss and
their consequences on synaptic dynamics in FXS has not been fully investigated.
METHODS: Here, we used an Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model to investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying FXS by monitoring protein expression changes
using shotgun label-free liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS(E)) in
brain tissue and synaptosome fractions. FXS-associated candidate proteins were
validated using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in synaptosome fractions for
targeted protein quantification. Furthermore, functional alterations in synaptic 
release and dynamics were evaluated using live-cell imaging, and interpretation
of synaptic dynamics differences was investigated using electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Key findings relate to altered levels of proteins involved in
GABA-signalling, especially in the cerebellum. Further exploration using
microscopy studies found reduced synaptic vesicle unloading of hippocampal
neurons and increased vesicle unloading in cerebellar neurons, which suggests a
general decrease of synaptic transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that FMRP is a regulator of synaptic vesicle
dynamics, which supports the role of FMRP in presynaptic functions. Taken
together, these studies provide novel insights into the molecular changes
associated with FXS.

Altered function of the Gq-coupled, Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors,
specifically mGlu5, is implicated in multiple mouse models of autism and
intellectual disability. mGlu5 dysfunction has been most well characterized in
the fragile X syndrome mouse model, the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, where
pharmacological and genetic reduction of mGlu5 reverses many phenotypes. mGlu5 is
less associated with its scaffolding protein Homer in Fmr1 KO mice, and
restoration of mGlu5-Homer interactions by genetic deletion of a short, dominant 
negative of Homer, H1a, rescues many phenotypes of Fmr1 KO mice. These results
suggested that disruption of mGlu5-Homer leads to phenotypes of FXS. To test this
idea, we examined mice with a knockin mutation of mGlu5 (F1128R; mGlu5(R/R)) that
abrogates binding to Homer. Although FMRP levels were normal, mGlu5(R/R) mice
mimicked multiple phenotypes of Fmr1 KO mice, including reduced mGlu5 association
with the postsynaptic density, enhanced constitutive mGlu5 signaling to protein
synthesis, deficits in agonist-induced translational control, protein
synthesis-independent LTD, neocortical hyperexcitability, audiogenic seizures,
and altered behaviors, including anxiety and sensorimotor gating. These results
reveal new roles for the Homer scaffolds in regulation of mGlu5 function and
implicate a specific molecular mechanism in a complex brain disease.SIGNIFICANCE 
STATEMENT: Abnormal function of the metabotropic, or Gq-coupled, glutamate
receptor 5 (mGlu5) has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including
a genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism called fragile X syndrome. 
In brains of a mouse model of fragile X, mGlu5 is less associated with its
binding partner Homer, a scaffolding protein that regulates mGlu5 localization to
synapses and its ability to activate biochemical signaling pathways. Here we show
that a mouse expressing a mutant mGlu5 that cannot bind to Homer is sufficient to
mimic many of the biochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral symptoms
observed in the fragile X mouse. This work provides strong evidence that
Homer-mGlu5 binding contributes to symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental
disorders.

Sensory processing deficits are common in autism spectrum disorders, but the
underlying mechanisms are unclear. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic 
cause of intellectual disability and autism. Electrophysiological responses in
humans with FXS show reduced habituation with sound repetition and this deficit
may underlie auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. Our previous study in Fmr1
knockout (KO) mice revealed an unusually long state of increased sound-driven
excitability in auditory cortical neurons suggesting that cortical responses to
repeated sounds may exhibit abnormal habituation as in humans with FXS. Here, we 
tested this prediction by comparing cortical event related potentials (ERP)
recorded from wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. We report a repetition-rate
dependent reduction in habituation of N1 amplitude in Fmr1 KO mice and show that 
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to
the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation 
of MMP-9 levels in the auditory cortex of adult Fmr1 KO mice, whereas a genetic
deletion of Mmp-9 reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the
N1 amplitude of Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings,
the habituation of ERPs in Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice implicating 
MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS.
Together these data establish ERP habituation as a translation relevant,
physiological pre-clinical marker of auditory processing deficits in FXS and
suggest that abnormal MMP-9 regulation is a mechanism underlying auditory
hypersensitivity in FXS.SIGNIFICANCE: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading
known genetic cause of autism spectrum disorders. Individuals with FXS show
symptoms of auditory hypersensitivity. These symptoms may arise due to sustained 
neural responses to repeated sounds, but the underlying mechanisms remain
unclear. For the first time, this study shows deficits in habituation of neural
responses to repeated sounds in the Fmr1 KO mice as seen in humans with FXS. We
also report an abnormally high level of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the
auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and that deletion of Mmp-9 from Fmr1 KO mice
reverses habituation deficits. These data provide a translation relevant
electrophysiological biomarker for sensory deficits in FXS and implicate MMP-9 as
a target for drug discovery.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include a range of complex neurodevelopmental
disorders with extreme genetic heterogeneity. Exome and target sequencing studies
have shown to be an effective tool for the discovery of new ASD genes. The aim of
this study was to design an ASD candidate gene panel that covers 44 of the top
ASD candidate genes. As a pilot study we performed comprehensive molecular
diagnostic testing, including the study of the FMR1 and FMR2 repeat regions, copy
number variant analysis in a collection of 50 Spanish ASD cases and mutation
screening using targeted next generation sequencing-based techniques in 44 out of
the total cohort. We evaluated and clinically selected our cohort, with most of
the cases having high functioning ASD without facial dysmorphic features. The
results of the present study allowed the detection of copy number and single
nucleotide variants not yet identified. In addition, our results underscore the
difficulty of the molecular diagnosis of ASD and confirm its genetic
heterogeneity. The information gained from this and other genetic screenings is
necessary to unravel the clinical interpretation of novel variants.

Introduction: We recently uncovered a signaling mechanism by which the
endocannabinoid anandamide mediates the action of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that
is crucial for social behavior, to control social reward. Oxytocin signaling has 
been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and social reward is a key
aspect of social functioning that is thought to be disrupted in ASD. Therefore,
as a proof of principle for the core component of ASD-social impairment-we tested
an endocannabinoid-enhancing compound on two widely studied mouse models of ASD, 
the BTBR and fmr1-/- (model of Fragile X Syndrome). Methods: We used the
established three-chambered social approach test. We specifically increased the
activity of anandamide by administering the compound URB597, a selective
inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the hydrolytic enzyme for
anandamide. Results: Remarkably, we found that FAAH blockade completely reversed 
the social impairment in both mouse models. CB1 receptor blockade prevented the
prosocial action of FAAH inhibition in BTBR mice. These results were likely
independent of effects on anxiety, as FAAH inhibition did not alter the
performance of BTBR mice in the elevated plus maze. Conclusions: The results
suggest that increasing anandamide activity at CB1 receptors improves ASD-related
social impairment and identify FAAH as a novel therapeutic target for ASD.

Fragile X syndrome is a monogenic disorder and a common cause of intellectual
disability. Despite nearly 25 years of research on FMR1, the gene underlying the 
syndrome, very few pathological mutations other than the typical CGG-repeat
expansion have been reported. This is in contrast to other X-linked, monogenic,
intellectual disability disorders, such as Rett syndrome, where many point
mutations have been validated as causative of the disorder. As technology has
improved and significantly driven down the cost of sequencing, allowing for whole
genes to be sequenced with relative ease, in-depth sequencing studies on FMR1
have recently been performed. These studies have led to the identification of
novel variants in FMR1, where some of which have been functionally evaluated and 
are likely pathogenic. In this review, we discuss recently identified FMR1
variants, the ways these novel variants cause dysfunction, and how they reveal
new regulatory mechanisms and functionalities of the gene.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable single gene cause of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). FMR1-KO mice mimic the etiology and phenotypic
manifestations of FXS. Neuroanatomical changes in specific brain regions have
been reported in clinical settings and in preclinical models. FMR1-KO mice have
been generated in different strains including C57Bl/6 (B6) and FVB. Mice on
different genetic backgrounds have stable yet distinct behavioral phenotypes that
may lead to unique gene-strain interactions on brain structure. Previous magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) studies have examined FMR1 knockout male mice on a B6 and
found few differences compared to wild-type mice. Here, we examine brain volumes 
in FMR1 knockout male mice on a FVB background using high resolution
(multi-channel 7.0Tesla) MRI. We observe multiple differences in the neuroanatomy
of male FMR1-/y mice on a FVB background. Significantly larger relative volume (%
total brain volume) differences were found in major white matter structures
throughout the brain. In addition, there were changes in areas associated with
fronto-striatal circuitry and other regions. Functional and structural
connectivity differences are often seen in human ASD, and therefore, this
increased white matter seen in the FMR1-KO-FVB could be highlighting a structural
over-connectivity, which could lead to some of the behavioral abnormalities seen 
with the FMR1-KO-FVB mice. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of
genetic strain contribution to brain structure.

Fragile-X syndrome is the most commonly inherited cause of autism and mental
disabilities. The Fmr1 (Fragile-X Mental Retardation 1) gene is essential in
humans and Drosophila for the maintenance of neural stem cells, and Fmr1 loss
results in neurological and reproductive developmental defects in humans and
flies. FMRP (Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein) is a nucleo-cytoplasmic
shuttling protein, involved in mRNA silencing and translational repression. Both 
Zfrp8 and Fmr1 have essential functions in the Drosophila ovary. In this study,
we identified FMRP, Nufip (Nuclear Fragile-X Mental Retardation
Protein-interacting Protein) and Tral (Trailer Hitch) as components of a Zfrp8
protein complex. We show that Zfrp8 is required in the nucleus, and controls
localization of FMRP in the cytoplasm. In addition, we demonstrate that Zfrp8
genetically interacts with Fmr1 and tral in an antagonistic manner. Zfrp8 and
FMRP both control heterochromatin packaging, also in opposite ways. We propose
that Zfrp8 functions as a chaperone, controlling protein complexes involved in
RNA processing in the nucleus.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited intellectual
disability and autistic spectrum disorder, is typically caused by transcriptional
silencing of the X-linked FMR1 gene. Work in animal models has described altered 
synaptic plasticity, a result of the up-regulation of metabotropic glutamate
receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated signaling, as a putative downstream effect. Post hoc
analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover phase 2 trial suggested
that the selective mGluR5 antagonist mavoglurant improved behavioral symptoms in 
FXS patients with completely methylated FMR1 genes. We present the results of two
phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group studies of mavoglurant in FXS, designed to confirm this result in 
adults (n = 175, aged 18 to 45 years) and adolescents (n = 139, aged 12 to 17
years). In both trials, participants were stratified by methylation status and
randomized to receive mavoglurant (25, 50, or 100 mg twice daily) or placebo over
12 weeks. Neither of the studies achieved the primary efficacy end point of
improvement on behavioral symptoms measured by the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist-Community Edition using the FXS-specific algorithm (ABC-C(FX)) after 12
weeks of treatment with mavoglurant. The safety and tolerability profile of
mavoglurant was as previously described, with few adverse events. Therefore,
under the conditions of our study, we could not confirm the mGluR theory of FXS
nor the ability of the methylation state of the FMR1 promoter to predict
mavoglurant efficacy. Preclinical results suggest that future clinical trials
might profitably explore initiating treatment in a younger population with longer
treatment duration and longer placebo run-ins and identifying new markers to
better assess behavioral and cognitive benefits.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present unique challenges in the fields of
genetics and neurobiology because of the clinical and molecular heterogeneity
underlying these disorders. Genetic mutations found in ASD patients provide
opportunities to dissect the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying autistic
behaviors using animal models. Ongoing studies of genetically modified models
have offered critical insight into possible common mechanisms arising from
different mutations, but links between molecular abnormalities and behavioral
phenotypes remain elusive. The challenges encountered in modeling autism in mice 
demand a new analytic paradigm that integrates behavioral assessment with
circuit-level analysis in genetically modified models with strong construct
validity.

BACKGROUND: FMR1 full mutations (FMs) (CGG expansion >200) in males mosaic for a 
normal (<45 CGG) or gray-zone (GZ) (45-54 CGG) allele can be missed with the
standard 2-step fragile X syndrome (FXS) testing protocols, largely because the
first-line PCR tests showing a normal or GZ allele are not reflexed to the
second-line test that can detect FM.
METHODS: We used methylation-specific quantitative melt analysis (MS-QMA) to
determine the prevalence of cryptic FM alleles in 2 independent cohorts of male
patients (994 from Chile and 2392 from Australia) referred for FXS testing from
2006 to 2013. All MS-QMA-positive cases were retested with commercial triplet
primed PCR, methylation-sensitive Southern blot, and a methylation-specific
EpiTYPER-based test.
RESULTS: All 38 FMs detected with the standard 2-step protocol were detected with
MS-QMA. However, MS-QMA identified methylation mosaicism in an additional 15% and
11% of patients in the Chilean and Australian cohorts, respectively, suggesting
the presence of a cryptic FM. Of these additional patients, 57% were confirmed to
carry cryptic expanded alleles in blood, buccal mucosa, or saliva samples.
Further confirmation was provided by identifying premutation (CGG 55-199) alleles
in mothers of probands with methylation-sensitive Southern blot. Neurocognitive
assessments showed that low-level mosaicism for cryptic FM alleles was associated
with cognitive impairment or autism.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of mosaic FM males who have cognitive
impairment or autism are not diagnosed with the currently recommended 2-step
testing protocol and can be identified with MS-QMA as a first-line test.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retardation
and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS
is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene
resulting in the transcriptional silencing of the gene in the pathophysiology of 
Fragile X syndrome was hypothesized. 23 male patients affected by Fragile X
syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1 gene) and 24 controls were included in the
study. The serum levels of HDL-C were lower in FXS patients (p < 0.001). The
serum levels triacylglycerols were higher in FXS patients (p = 0.007) Further
study involving larger samples are necessary to confirm the results and define
the health implications for abnormal lipid levels in FXS patients.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability disorder and a frequent cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is
characterized by a high prevalence of sensory symptoms. Perturbations in the
anatomical connectivity of neocortical circuits resulting in their functional
defects have been hypothesized to contribute to the underlying etiology of these 
disorders. We tested this idea by probing alterations in the functional and
structural connectivity of both local and long-ranging neocortical circuits in
the Fmr1 (-/y) mouse model of FXS. To achieve this, we combined in vivo
ultrahigh-field diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional
MRI, and viral tracing approaches in adult mice. Our results show an anatomical
hyperconnectivity phenotype for the primary visual cortex (V1), but a
disproportional low connectivity of V1 with other neocortical regions. These
structural data are supported by defects in the structural integrity of the
subcortical white matter in the anterior and posterior forebrain. These
anatomical alterations might contribute to the observed functional decoupling
across neocortical regions. We therefore identify FXS as a "connectopathy,"
providing a translational model for understanding sensory processing defects and 
functional decoupling of neocortical areas in FXS and ASD.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose
biochemical manifestations involve dysregulation of mGluR5-dependent pathways,
which are widely modeled using cultured neurons. In vitro phenotypes in cultured 
neurons using standard morphological, functional, and chemical approaches have
demonstrated considerable variability. Here, we study transcriptomes obtained in 
situ in the intact brain tissues of a murine model of FXS to see how they reflect
the in vitro state.
METHODS: We used genome-wide mRNA expression profiling as a robust
characterization tool for studying differentially expressed pathways in fragile X
mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) murine primary
neuronal cultures and in embryonic hippocampal and cortical murine tissue. To
study the developmental trajectory and to relate mouse model data to human data, 
we used an expression map of human development to plot murine differentially
expressed genes in KO/WT cultures and brain.
RESULTS: We found that transcriptomes from cell cultures showed a stronger
signature of Fmr1KO than whole tissue transcriptomes. We observed an
over-representation of immunological signaling pathways in embryonic Fmr1KO
cortical and hippocampal tissues and over-represented mGluR5-downstream signaling
pathways in Fmr1KO cortical and hippocampal primary cultures. Genes whose
expression was up-regulated in Fmr1KO murine cultures tended to peak early in
human development, whereas differentially expressed genes in embryonic cortical
and hippocampal tissues clustered with genes expressed later in human
development.
CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional profile in brain tissues primarily centered on
immunological mechanisms, whereas the profiles from cell cultures showed defects 
in neuronal activity. We speculate that the isolation and culturing of neurons
caused a shift in neurological transcriptome towards a "juvenile" or
"de-differentiated" state. Moreover, cultured neurons lack the close coupling
with glia that might be responsible for the immunological phenotype in the intact
brain. Our results suggest that cultured cells may recapitulate an early phase of
the disease, which is also less obscured with a consequent "immunological"
phenotype and in vivo compensatory mechanisms observed in the embryonic brain.
Together, these results suggest that the transcriptome of cultured primary
neuronal cells, in comparison to whole brain tissue, more robustly demonstrated
the difference between Fmr1KO and WT mice and might reveal a molecular phenotype,
which is typically hidden by compensatory mechanisms present in vivo. Moreover,
cultures might be useful for investigating the perturbed pathways in early human 
brain development and genes previously implicated in autism.

Abnormal metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) function, as a result of
disrupted scaffolding with its binding partner Homer, contributes to the
pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, a common inherited form of intellectual
disability and autism caused by mutations in Fmr1. How loss of Fmr1 disrupts
mGluR5-Homer scaffolds is unknown, and little is known about the dynamic
regulation of mGluR5-Homer scaffolds in wild-type neurons. Here, we demonstrate
that brief (minutes-long) elevations in neural activity cause CaMKIIα-mediated
phosphorylation of long Homer proteins and dissociation from mGluR5 at synapses. 
In Fmr1 knockout (KO) cortex, Homers are hyperphosphorylated as a result of
elevated CaMKIIα protein. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CaMKIIα or
replacement of Homers with dephosphomimetics restores mGluR5-Homer scaffolds and 
multiple Fmr1 KO phenotypes, including circuit hyperexcitability and/or seizures.
This work links translational control of an FMRP target mRNA, CaMKIIα, to the
molecular-, cellular-, and circuit-level brain dysfunction in a complex
neurodevelopmental disorder.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the major causes for autism and mental
retardation in humans. The etiology of FXS is linked to the expansion of the CGG 
trinucleotide repeats, r(CGG), suppressing the fragile X mental retardation 1
(FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, resulting in a loss of fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP) expression, which is required for regulating normal
neuronal connectivity and plasticity. Recent studies have further identified that
microRNAs are involved in the mechanisms underlying FXS pathogenesis at three
different developmental stages. During early embryogenesis before the blastocyst 
stage, an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific microRNA, miR-302, interferes with
FMR1 mRNA translation to maintain the stem cell status and inhibit neural
development. After blastocyst, the downregulation of miR-302 releases FMRP
synthesis and subsequently leads to neuronal development; yet, in FXS, certain
r(CGG)-derived microRNAs, such as miR-fmr1s, are expressed and accumulated and
then induce DNA hypermethylation on the FMR1 gene promoter regions, resulting in 
transcriptional inactivation of the FMR1 gene and the loss of FMRP. In normal
neuronal development, FMRP is an RNA-binding protein responsible for interacting 
with miR-125 and miR-132 to regulate the signaling of Group 1 metabotropic
glutamate receptor (mGluR1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR),
respectively, and consequently affecting synaptic plasticity. As a result, the
loss of FMRP impairs these signaling controls and eventually causes
FXS-associated disorders, such as autism and mental retardation. Based on these
current findings, this chapter will summarize the etiological causes of FXS and
further provides significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying
microRNA-mediated FXS pathogenesis and the related therapy development.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability and autism. The causal mutation in FXS is a trinucleotide CGG repeat
expansion in the FMR1 gene that leads to human specific epigenetic silencing and 
loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) expression. Human pluripotent
stem cells (PSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and particularly
induced PSCs (iPSCs), offer a model system to reveal cellular and molecular
events underlying human neuronal development and function in FXS. Human FXS PSCs 
have been established and have provided insight into the epigenetic silencing of 
the FMR1 gene as well as aspects of neuronal development.

Alterations in the efficacy of neuronal inhibition mediated by GABAA receptors
(GABAARs) containing β3 subunits are continually implicated in autism spectrum
disorders (ASDs). In vitro, the plasma membrane stability of GABAARs is
potentiated via phosphorylation of serine residues 408 and 409 (S408/9) in the β3
subunit, an effect that is mimicked by their mutation to alanines. To assess if
modifications in β3 subunit expression contribute to ASDs, we have created a
mouse in which S408/9 have been mutated to alanines (S408/9A). S408/9A
homozygotes exhibited increased phasic, but decreased tonic, inhibition, events
that correlated with alterations in the membrane stability and synaptic
accumulation of the receptor subtypes that mediate these distinct forms of
inhibition. S408/9A mice exhibited alterations in dendritic spine structure,
increased repetitive behavior, and decreased social interaction, hallmarks of
ASDs. ASDs are frequently comorbid with epilepsy, and consistent with this
comorbidity, S408/9A mice exhibited a marked increase in sensitivity to seizures 
induced by the convulsant kainic acid. To assess the relevance of our studies
using S408/9A mice for the pathophysiology of ASDs, we measured S408/9
phosphorylation in Fmr1 KO mice, a model of fragile X syndrome, the most common
monogenetic cause of ASDs. Phosphorylation of S408/9 was selectively and
significantly enhanced in Fmr1 KO mice. Collectively, our results suggest that
alterations in phosphorylation and/or activity of β3-containing GABAARs may
directly contribute to the pathophysiology of ASDs.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is mostly caused by a CGG triplet expansion in the
fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). Up to 60% of affected males fulfill
criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), making FXS the most frequent
monogenetic cause of syndromic ASD. It is unknown, however, whether normal
variants (independent of mutations) in the fragile X gene family (FMR1, FXR1,
FXR2) and in FMR2 modulate autistic features. Here, we report an accumulation
model of 8 SNPs in these genes, associated with autistic traits in a discovery
sample of male patients with schizophrenia (N = 692) and three independent
replicate samples: patients with schizophrenia (N = 626), patients with other
psychiatric diagnoses (N = 111) and a general population sample (N = 2005). For
first mechanistic insight, we contrasted microRNA expression in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells of selected extreme group subjects with high- versus low-risk
constellation regarding the accumulation model. Thereby, the brain-expressed
miR-181 species emerged as potential "umbrella regulator", with several seed
matches across the fragile X gene family and FMR2. To conclude, normal variation 
in these genes contributes to the continuum of autistic phenotypes.

The application of next-generation-sequencing based methods has recently allowed 
the sequence-specific occurrence of RNA modifications to be investigated in
transcriptome-wide settings. This has led to the emergence of a new field of
molecular genetics research termed "epitranscriptomics." Investigations have
shown that these modifications can exert control over protein synthesis via
various mechanisms, and particularly when occurring on messenger RNAs, can be
dynamically regulated. Here, we propose that RNA modifications may be a critical 
regulator over the spatiotemporal control of protein-synthesis in neurons, which 
is supported by our finding that the RNA methylase NSun2 colocalizes with the
translational-repressor FMRP at neuronal dendrites. We also observe that NSun2
commonly methylates mRNAs which encode components of the postsynaptic proteome,
and further find that NSun2 and FMRP likely share a common subset of mRNA targets
which include those that are known to be translated at dendrites in an
activity-dependent manner. We consider potential roles for RNA modifications in
space- time- and activity-dependent regulation of protein synthesis in neuronal
physiology, with a particular focus on synaptic plasticity modulation.

Many evidences indicate that mice lacking the homeobox transcription factor
engrailed-2 (En2(-/-) mice) represent a reliable model to investigate
neurodevelopmental basis and gene expression changes relevant to autism spectrum 
disorders. Dysfunctions in fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP),
metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), and GABAergic signaling pathways have
been proposed as a possible pathogenic mechanism of autism spectrum disorders.
Here, we exploited En2(-/-) mice to investigate hippocampal expression of FMRP,
mGluR5, and GABA(A) receptor β3 subunit (GABRB3). Quantitative
reverse-transcription PCR showed that all these mRNAs were significantly
downregulated in En2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type littermates. Western blot 
and immunohistochemistry confirmed the downregulation of FMRP and GABRB3
proteins, while showing a significant increase of mGluR5 protein in the En2(-/-) 
hippocampus. Our results suggest that the dysregulation of FMRP-mGluR5 signaling 
pathway, accompanied with a downregulation of GABRB3 expression, may contribute
to the 'autistic-like' features observed in En2 mice, providing possible
molecular targets for future pharmacological studies.

Previous studies have hypothesized that diverse genetic causes of intellectual
disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) converge on common cellular 
pathways. Testing this hypothesis requires detailed phenotypic analyses of animal
models with genetic mutations that accurately reflect those seen in the human
condition (i.e., have structural validity) and which produce phenotypes that
mirror ID/ASDs (i.e., have face validity). We show that SynGAP
haploinsufficiency, which causes ID with co-occurring ASD in humans, mimics and
occludes the synaptic pathophysiology associated with deletion of the Fmr1 gene. 
Syngap(+/-) and Fmr1(-/y) mice show increases in basal protein synthesis and
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression that,
unlike in their wild-type controls, is independent of new protein synthesis.
Basal levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 are also elevated in Syngap(+/-)
hippocampal slices. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that Syngap(+/-) and
Fmr1(-/y) mice show nanoscale alterations in dendritic spine morphology that
predict an increase in biochemical compartmentalization. Finally, increased basal
protein synthesis is rescued by negative regulators of the mGlu subtype 5
receptor and the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway, indicating that therapeutic interventions
for fragile X syndrome may benefit patients with SYNGAP1
haploinsufficiency.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As the genetics of intellectual
disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are unraveled, a key issue
is whether genetically divergent forms of these disorders converge on common
biochemical/cellular pathways and hence may be amenable to common therapeutic
interventions. This study compares the pathophysiology associated with the loss
of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and haploinsufficiency of synaptic
GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP), two prevalent monogenic forms of ID. We show 
that Syngap(+/-) mice phenocopy Fmr1(-/y) mice in the alterations in
mGluR-dependent long-term depression, basal protein synthesis, and dendritic
spine morphology. Deficits in basal protein synthesis can be rescued by
pharmacological interventions that reduce the mGlu5 receptor-ERK1/2 signaling
pathway, which also rescues the same deficit in Fmr1(-/y) mice. Our findings
support the hypothesis that phenotypes associated with genetically diverse forms 
of ID/ASDs result from alterations in common cellular/biochemical pathways.

Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of intellectual disability and autism
spectrum disorder. The gene underlying the disorder, fragile X mental retardation
1 (FMR1), is silenced in most cases by a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the 5' 
untranslated region (UTR). Recently, we identified a variant located in the 3'UTR
of FMR1 enriched among developmentally delayed males with normal repeat lengths. 
A patient-derived cell line revealed reduced levels of endogenous fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP), and a reporter containing a patient 3'UTR
caused a decrease in expression. A control reporter expressed in cultured mouse
cortical neurons showed an expected increase following synaptic stimulation that 
was absent when expressing the patient reporter, suggesting an impaired response 
to neuronal activity. Mobility-shift assays using a control RNA detected an
RNA-protein interaction that is lost with the patient RNA, and HuR was
subsequently identified as an associated protein. Cross-linking
immunoprecipitation experiments identified the locus as an in vivo target of HuR,
supporting our in vitro findings. These data suggest that the disrupted
interaction of HuR impairs activity-dependent translation of FMRP, which may
hinder synaptic plasticity in a clinically significant fashion.

Rapid progress in identifying the genes underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
has provided the substrate for a first wave of analyses into the underlying
neurobiology. This review describes the consensus across these diverse analyses, 
highlighting two distinct sets of genes: 1) Genes that regulate chromatin and
transcription, especially in cortical projection neurons and striatal medium
spiny neurons during mid-fetal development; and 2) Genes involved in synapse
development and function, especially during infancy and early childhood, and
differentially expressed in the post mortem ASD brain. Both gene sets are also
regulatory targets of the ASD genes CHD8 and FMRP. It remains to be seen whether 
these represent two independent paths to the ASD phenotype or two components of a
common path.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome, the most common single gene cause of autism,
results from loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Although FMRP is highly
expressed in neurons, it has also recently been identified in glia. It has been
postulated that in the absence of FMRP, abnormal function of non-neuronal cells
may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. We previously demonstrated
reduced numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and delayed myelination in the
cerebellum of fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mice.
METHODS: We used quantitative western blotting and immunocytochemistry to examine
the status of astrocytes and microglia in the cerebellum of Fmr1 mice during
development and in adulthood.
RESULTS: We report increased expression of the astrocyte marker GFAP in the
cerebellum of Fmr1 mice starting in the second postnatal week and persisting in
to adulthood. At 2 weeks postnatal, expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 
2 (TNFR2) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) were elevated in the Fmr1 KO
cerebellum. In adults, expression of TNFR2 and the glial marker S100β were also
elevated in Fmr1 knockouts, but LIF expression was not different from wild-type
mice. We found no evidence of microglial activation or neuroinflammation at any
age examined.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an atypical pattern of astrogliosis in
the absence of microglial activation in Fmr1 knockout mouse cerebellum. Enhanced 
TNFR2 and LIF expression in young mice suggests that changes in the expression of
astrocytic proteins may be an attempt to compensate for delayed myelination in
the developing cerebellum of Fmr1 mice.

Patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS) exhibit moderate to severe intellectual
disabilities. In addition, one-third of FXS patients show characteristics of
autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion,
which leads to silencing of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene. The
absence of the FMR1 gene product, FMRP, is the reason for the disease symptoms.
It has been suggested that repeat instability and transcription of the FMR1 gene 
occur during early embryonic development, while after cell differentiation
repeats become stable and the FMR1 gene is silent. Epigenetic marks, such as DNA 
methylation, are associated with gene silencing and repeat stability at the FMR1 
locus. However, the mechanisms leading to gene silencing and repeat expansion are
still ambiguous, because studies at the human genomic locus were limited until
now. The FXS pluripotent stem cells, recently derived from FXS adult cells and
FXS blastocysts, are new useful tools to examine these mechanisms at the human
endogenous FMR1 locus. This review summarizes the epigenetic features and
experimental studies of FXS human embryonic and FXS induced pluripotent stem
cells, generated so far. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI:
Exploiting human neurons.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 2% of children, and is characterized by
impaired social and communication skills together with repetitive, stereotypic
behavior. The pathophysiology of ASD is complex due to genetic and environmental 
heterogeneity, complicating the development of therapies and making diagnosis
challenging. Growing genetic evidence supports a role of disrupted Ca(2+)
signaling in ASD. Here, we report that patient-derived fibroblasts from three
monogenic models of ASD-fragile X and tuberous sclerosis TSC1 and TSC2
syndromes-display depressed Ca(2+) release through inositol trisphosphate
receptors (IP3Rs). This was apparent in Ca(2+) signals evoked by G
protein-coupled receptors and by photoreleased IP3 at the levels of both global
and local elementary Ca(2+) events, suggesting fundamental defects in IP3R
channel activity in ASD. Given the ubiquitous involvement of IP3R-mediated Ca(2+)
signaling in neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, gene expression and
neurodevelopment, we propose dysregulated IP3R signaling as a nexus where genes
altered in ASD converge to exert their deleterious effect. These findings
highlight potential pharmaceutical targets, and identify Ca(2+) screening in skin
fibroblasts as a promising technique for early detection of individuals
susceptible to ASD.

Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is a regulatory RNA binding protein
that plays a central role in the development of several human disorders including
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism. FMRP uses an arginine-glycine-rich (RGG)
motif for specific interactions with guanine (G)-quadruplexes, mRNA elements
implicated in the disease-associated regulation of specific mRNAs. Here we report
the 2.8-Å crystal structure of the complex between the human FMRP RGG peptide
bound to the in vitro selected G-rich RNA. In this model system, the RNA adopts
an intramolecular K(+)-stabilized G-quadruplex structure composed of three
G-quartets and a mixed tetrad connected to an RNA duplex. The RGG peptide
specifically binds to the duplex-quadruplex junction, the mixed tetrad, and the
duplex region of the RNA through shape complementarity, cation-π interactions,
and multiple hydrogen bonds. Many of these interactions critically depend on a
type I β-turn, a secondary structure element whose formation was not previously
recognized in the RGG motif of FMRP. RNA mutagenesis and footprinting experiments
indicate that interactions of the peptide with the duplex-quadruplex junction and
the duplex of RNA are equally important for affinity and specificity of the
RGG-RNA complex formation. These results suggest that specific binding of
cellular RNAs by FMRP may involve hydrogen bonding with RNA duplexes and that RNA
duplex recognition can be a characteristic RNA binding feature for RGG motifs in 
other proteins.

BACKGROUND: In the adult brain, structural plasticity allowing gain or loss of
synapses remodels circuits to support learning. In fragile X syndrome, the
absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to defects in
plasticity and learning deficits. FMRP is a master regulator of local translation
but its implication in learning-induced structural plasticity is unknown.
METHODS: Using an olfactory learning task requiring adult-born olfactory bulb
neurons and cell-specific ablation of FMRP, we investigated whether learning
shapes adult-born neuron morphology during their synaptic integration and its
dependence on FMRP. We used alpha subunit of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent
kinase II (αCaMKII) mutant mice with altered dendritic localization of αCaMKII
messenger RNA, as well as a reporter of αCaMKII local translation to investigate 
the role of this FMRP messenger RNA target in learning-dependent structural
plasticity.
RESULTS: Learning induces profound changes in dendritic architecture and spine
morphology of adult-born neurons that are prevented by ablation of FMRP in
adult-born neurons and rescued by an metabotropic glutamate receptor 5
antagonist. Moreover, dendritically translated αCaMKII is necessary for learning 
and associated structural modifications and learning triggers an FMRP-dependent
increase of αCaMKII dendritic translation in adult-born neurons.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that FMRP mediates structural
plasticity of olfactory bulb adult-born neurons to support olfactory learning
through αCaMKII local translation. This reveals a new role for FMRP-regulated
dendritic local translation in learning-induced structural plasticity. This might
be of clinical relevance for the understanding of critical periods disruption in 
autism spectrum disorder patients, among which fragile X syndrome is the primary 
monogenic cause.

Fragile X spectrum disorder (FXSD) includes: fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile
X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary
ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), as well as other medical, psychiatric and
neurobehavioral problems associated with the premutation and gray zone alleles.
FXS is the most common monogenetic cause of autism (ASD) and intellectual
disability (ID). The understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has led to many
targeted treatment trials in FXS. The first wave of phase II clinical trials in
FXS were designed to target the mGluR5 pathway; however the results did not show 
significant efficacy and the trials were terminated. The advances in the
understanding of the GABA system in FXS have shifted the focus of treatment
trials to GABA agonists, and a new wave of promising clinical trials is under
way. Ganaxolone and allopregnanolone (GABA agonists) have been studied in
individuals with FXSD and are currently in phase II trials. Both allopregnanolone
and ganaxolone may be efficacious in treatment of FXS and FXTAS, respectively.
Allopregnanolone, ganaxolone, riluzole, gaboxadol, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are 
potential GABAergic treatments. The lessons learned from the initial trials have 
not only shifted the targeted system, but also have refined the design of
clinical trials. The results of these new trials will likely impact further
clinical trials for FXS and other genetic disorders associated with ASD.

Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation associated phenotypes have been
explored extensively since the molecular mechanism emerged involving elevated
FMR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels. Lowered fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP) can also occur which may have an additive effect to
the high levels of mRNA leading to neurodevelopmental problems and
psychopathology. This paper was aimed to review psychosis and catatonia in
premutation carriers, express the role of elevated FMR1 mRNA and lowered FMRP in 
the phenotype of carriers and present a case of psychosis and catatonia in a
carrier. This case also demonstrates additional genetic and environmental factors
which may also affect the phenotype. We review the literature and report an
exemplary case of a 25 year old male premutation carrier with elevated FMR1 mRNA,
low FMRP, a cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily D polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6)*2xN
mutation and a perinatal insult. This patient developed an autism spectrum
disorder, psychosis, catatonia with subsequent cognitive decline after
electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) for his catatonia. He had a premutation of 72
CGG repeat in FMR1, FMR1 mRNA level that was over 2.4 times normal and FMRP level
at 18% of normal, and additionally, a CYP2D6 allelic variant which leads to
ultrarapid metabolism (UM) of medication. There is an overlapping
pathophysiological mechanism of catatonia and fragile X-associated premutation
phenotypes including autism and psychosis. This case demonstrates the shared
phenotype and the overlap of the pathophysiological mechanisms that can influence
the intervention. Multiple genetic and environmental hits can lead to more
significant involvement in premutation carriers.

CGG repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are
responsible for a family of associated disorders characterized by either
intellectual disability and autism Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), or adult-onset
neurodegeneration Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome. However, the FMR1 
locus is complex and encodes several long non-coding RNAs, whose expression is
altered by repeat expansion mutations. The role of these lncRNAs is thus far
unknown; therefore we investigated the functionality of FMR4, which we previously
identified. "Full"-length expansions of the FMR1 triplet repeat cause silencing
of both FMR1 and FMR4, thus we are interested in potential loss-of-function that 
may add to phenotypic manifestation of FXS. Since the two transcripts do not
exhibit cis-regulation of one another, we examined the potential for FMR4 to
regulate target genes at distal genomic loci using gene expression microarrays.
We identified FMR4-responsive genes, including the methyl-CpG-binding domain
protein 4 (MBD4). Furthermore, we found that in differentiating human neural
precursor cells, FMR4 expression is developmentally regulated in opposition to
expression of both FMR1 (which is expected to share a bidirectional promoter with
FMR4) and MBD4. We therefore propose that FMR4's function is as a gene-regulatory
lncRNA and that this transcript may function in normal development. Closer
examination of FMR4 increases our understanding of the role of regulatory lncRNA 
and the consequences of FMR1 repeat expansions.

Alterations in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory transmission are emerging as
a common component of many nervous system disorders, including autism spectrum
disorders (ASDs). Tonic γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission
provided by peri- and extrasynaptic GABA type A (GABAA ) receptors powerfully
controls neuronal excitability and plasticity and, therefore, provides a rational
therapeutic target for normalizing hyperexcitable networks across a variety of
disorders, including ASDs. Our previous studies revealed tonic GABAergic deficits
in principal excitatory neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the
Fmr1(-/y) knockout (KO) mouse model fragile X syndrome. To correct amygdala
deficits in tonic GABAergic neurotransmission in Fmr1(-/y) KO mice, we developed 
a novel positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, SGE-872, based on
endogenously active neurosteroids. This study shows that SGE-872 is nearly as
potent and twice as efficacious for positively modulating GABAA receptors as its 
parent molecule, allopregnanolone. Furthermore, at submicromolar concentrations
(≤1 μM), SGE-872 is selective for tonic, extrasynaptic α4β3δ-containing GABAA
receptors over typical synaptic α1β2γ2 receptors. We further find that SGE-872
strikingly rescues the tonic GABAergic transmission deficit in principal
excitatory neurons in the Fmr1(-/y) KO BLA, a structure heavily implicated in the
neuropathology of ASDs. Therefore, the potent and selective action of SGE-872 on 
tonic GABAA receptors containing α4 subunits may represent a novel and highly
useful therapeutic avenue for ASDs and related disorders involving
hyperexcitability of neuronal networks.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder characterized
by severe intellectual disability and other symptoms including autism. Although
caused by the silencing of a single gene, Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1), 
the complexity of FXS pathogenesis is amplified because the encoded protein,
FMRP, regulates the activity-dependent translation of numerous mRNAs. Although
the mRNAs that associate with FMRP have been extensively studied, little is known
regarding the proteins whose expression levels are altered, directly or
indirectly, by loss of FMRP during brain development. Here we systematically
measured protein expression in neocortical synaptic fractions from Fmr1 knockout 
(KO) and wild-type (WT) mice at both adolescent and adult stages. Although
hundreds of proteins are up-regulated in the absence of FMRP in young mice, this 
up-regulation is largely diminished in adulthood. Up-regulated proteins included 
previously unidentified as well as known targets involved in synapse formation
and function and brain development and others linked to intellectual disability
and autism. Comparison with putative FMRP target mRNAs and autism susceptibility 
genes revealed substantial overlap, consistent with the idea that the autism
endophenotype of FXS is due to a "multiple hit" effect of FMRP loss, particularly
within the PSD95 interactome. Through studies of de novo protein synthesis in
primary cortical neurons from KO and WT mice, we found that neurons lacking FMRP 
produce nascent proteins at higher rates, many of which are synaptic proteins and
encoded by FMRP target mRNAs. Our results provide a greatly expanded view of
protein changes in FXS and identify age-dependent effects of FMRP in shaping the 
neuronal proteome.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heritable disorders with complex and
unclear etiology. Classic ASD symptoms include social interaction and
communication deficits as well as restricted, repetitive behaviors. In addition, 
ASD is often comorbid with intellectual disability. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is
the leading genetic cause of ASD, and is the most commonly inherited form of
intellectual disability. Several mouse models of ASD and FXS exist, however the
intellectual disability observed in ASD patients is not well modeled in mice.
Using the Fmr1 knockout mouse and the eIF4E transgenic mouse, two previously
characterized mouse models of fragile X syndrome and ASD, respectively, we
generated the eIF4E/Fmr1 double mutant mouse. Our study shows that the eIF4E/Fmr1
double mutant mice display classic ASD behaviors, as well as cognitive
dysfunction. Importantly, the learning impairments displayed by the double mutant
mice spanned multiple cognitive tasks. Moreover, the eIF4E/Fmr1 double mutant
mice display increased levels of basal protein synthesis. The results of our
study suggest that the eIF4E/Fmr1 double mutant mouse may be a reliable model to 
study cognitive dysfunction in the context of ASD.

Fmr1 and FMRP underlie Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and are linked with related
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Fmr1 also has an essential role in eye and lens 
development. Lenses express FMRP along with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors 
(GABARs), post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), Tyr-phosphatase STEP,
CaMKIIα and Alzheimer's disease Aβ precursor protein, which are verified targets 
of FMRP regulation in neurons and outline major topics in FXS/ASD research.
PSD-95 as well as CaMKIIα transcripts undergo polypryimidine tract binding
protein dependent alternative splicing in lens, consistent with PSD-95
translation in lens. At least 13 GABAR subunits and GAD25/65/67 GABA metabolism
enzymes are expressed in lenses beginning in embryonic development, matching
neural development. Interestingly, GABAergic drugs (e.g. baclofen) studied as
FXS/ASD therapeutics are shown to resolve developmental vision defects in
experimental myopia. Here, we demonstrated that FMRP co-localizes at fiber cell
membranes with PSD-95, GABAAδ, GABAAβ3, GABBR1, STEP, CaMKIIα, and mGluR5 in
young adult lenses. GAD65 and GABA detection was greatest at the peri-nuclear
lens region where fiber cell terminal differentiation occurs. These findings add 
to an extensive list of detailed parallels between fiber cell and neuron
morphology and their lateral membrane spine/protrusions, also reflected in the
shared expression of genes involved in the morphogenesis and function of these
membrane structures, and shared use of associated regulatory mechanisms first
described as distinguishing the neuronal phenotype. Future studies can determine 
if GABA levels currently studied as a FXS/ASD biomarker in the brain, and
generated by GAD25/65/67 in a comparable cell environment in the lens, may be
similarly responsive to Fmr1 mutation in lens. The present demonstration of FMRP 
and key regulatory targets in the lens identifies a potential for the lens to
provide a new research venue, in the same individual, to inform about Fmr1/FMRP
pathobiology in brain as well as lens.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common, monogenetic cause of intellectual
disability and autism-spectrum disorders. Although there is no effective therapy,
greater understanding of disturbed neuronal pathways has introduced options for
targeted therapy. But whereas many FXS phenotypes were improved in preclinical
studies with drugs targeting these pathways in the FXS mouse model, attempts to
translate these animal-model success stories into treatment of patients in
clinical trials have been extremely disappointing. Complicating factors,
particularly in animal studies, include mouse inbred strains, variability in
functional studies between laboratories, publication bias and lack of reliable
and objective primary outcome measures in both mice and patients. Possibly most
important, however, is one factor that has been little explored: the complexity
of the molecular imbalance in FXS and the need to simultaneously target several
different disturbed pathways and different cellular compartments. New,
well-conceived animal studies should generate more productive approaches in the
quest for targeted therapy for FXS.

[General and Specific Mechanisms of Visual Cognitive Function Impairment in
People with FMRP Deficit].

[Article in Russian]

Pereverzeva DS, Danilina KK, Gorbachevskaya NL.

The purpose of this article is to provide the overview of visual cognitive
development in subjects with FMRP deficit. Description of fragile X mental
retardation syndrome is presented in the article, that is the most common cause
of inherited intellectual disability and one of the most prevalent genetic causes
of autism spectrum disorder. The syndrome is associated with deficit of fragile X
mental retardation protein following FMR1-gene mutation. Researches of static and
dynamic object perception, face perception and oculomotor control are discussed
in the article. The results obtained by subjects with FX syndrome are compared
with ASD data, syndrome with closed behavioral phenotype. Several factors that
underlie visual cognitive deficit are discussed in the article.

In this study the authors investigated whether dysregulation of the fragile X
mental retardation protein and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling cascade
can have a role in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy of prematurity following
perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. The authors examined the brain tissue of newborns
with encephalopathy and compared it to age-matched controls with normal brain
development and adults. In normal controls, the fragile X mental retardation
protein expression in cortical gray matter spiked 4-fold during 36-39 gestational
weeks compared to the adult, with a concomitant suppression of p70S6K and S6. In 
encephalopathy cases, the developmental spike of fragile X mental retardation
protein was not observed, and fragile X mental retardation protein levels
remained significantly lower than in normal controls. Importantly, this fragile X
mental retardation protein downregulation was followed by a significant
overexpression of p70S6K and S6. These novel findings thus suggest that premature
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury can affect the fragile X mental retardation
protein/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, as otherwise observed in inherited
syndromes of cognitive disability and autism spectrum disorders.

Defects in the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
(Ras)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are responsible 
for several neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are an important cause 
for intellectual disability; additional manifestations include autism spectrum
disorder, seizures, and brain malformations. Changes in synaptic function are
thought to underlie the neurological conditions associated with these syndromes. 
We therefore studied morphology and in vivo synaptic transmission of the calyx of
Held synapse, a relay synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) 
of the auditory brainstem, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC),
Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Costello syndrome. 
Calyces from both Tsc1(+/-) and from Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice showed increased
volume and surface area compared to wild-type (WT) controls. In addition, in Fmr1
KO animals a larger fraction of calyces showed complex morphology. In MNTB
principal neurons of Nf1 (+/) (-) mice the average delay between EPSPs and APs
was slightly smaller compared to WT controls, which could indicate an increased
excitability. Otherwise, no obvious changes in synaptic transmission, or
short-term plasticity were observed during juxtacellular recordings in any of the
four lines. Our results in these four mutants thus indicate that abnormalities of
mTOR or Ras signaling do not necessarily result in changes in in vivo synaptic
transmission.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder affecting
nearly one in 5000 newborn males and is a leading genetic cause of autism
spectrum disorder. In addition to developmental delays and intellectual
impairment, FXS is characterized by seizures, attention deficit, and
hypersensitivity to visual, tactile and auditory stimuli. The Fmr1 gene encodes
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is abundant in neurons, binds 
select mRNAs and functions as a negative regulator of mRNA translation. A
deficiency in FMRP, as in FXS and Fmr1 knockout (KO) animals, results in neuronal
dysmorphology and altered synaptic function. Additionally, there is evidence for 
disruption of GABAergic circuits in subjects lacking FMRP. Our previous studies
demonstrated widespread expression of FMRP in human auditory brainstem neurons.
Given this observation, we hypothesized that FMRP is highly expressed in rat
auditory brainstem neurons and that the auditory hypersensitivity characteristic 
of FXS results from dysfunction of brainstem networks secondary to decreased
expression of FMRP. In our investigation of postnatal day 50 (P50) control rats, 
we found that FMRP was widely expressed in neurons of the superior olivary
complex (SOC). In P50 Fmr1 KO rats, many SOC neurons had a smaller soma when
compared to controls, indicative of abnormal neuronal morphology. Additionally,
neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) were more round in Fmr1 KO rats. There
was also reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in neurons of 
the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) and a reduction in the number of
calretinin-immunoreactive terminals associated with neurons of the medial nucleus
of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Together, these findings support the conclusion
that the auditory dysfunction characteristic of FXS arises, at least in part,
from defective brainstem networks.

The aims of this study were to investigate behaviour relevant to human autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) and the fragile X syndrome in adolescent Fmr1 knockout
(KO) mice and to evaluate the tissue levels of striatal monoamines. Fmr1 KO mice 
were evaluated in the open field, marble burying and three-chamber test for the
presence of hyperactivity, anxiety, repetitive behaviour, sociability and
observation of social novelty compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The Fmr1 KO mice
expressed anxiety and hyperactivity in the open field compared with WT mice. This
increased level of hyperactivity was confirmed in the three-chamber test. Fmr1 KO
mice spent more time with stranger mice compared with the WT. However, after a
correction for hyperactivity, their apparent increase in sociability became
identical to that of the WT. Furthermore, the Fmr1 KO mice could not
differentiate between a familiar or a novel mouse. Monoamines were measured by
HPLC: Fmr1 KO mice showed an increase in the striatal dopamine level. We conclude
that the fragile X syndrome model seems to be useful for understanding certain
aspects of ASD and may have translational interest for studies of social
behaviour when hyperactivity coexists in ASD patients.

While prolonged sleep deprivation (SD) could lead to profound negative health
consequences, such as impairments in vital biological functions of immunity and
cognition, melatonin possesses powerful ameliorating effects against those
harmful insults. Melatonin has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects
that help to restore body's immune and cognitive functions. In this study, we
investigated the possible role of melatonin in reversing cognitive dysfunction
induced by SD in rats. Our experimental results revealed that sleep-deprived
animals exhibited spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze tasks
compared with the control groups. Furthermore, there was an increased glial
activation most prominent in the hippocampal region of the SD group compared to
the normal control (NC) group. Additionally, markers of oxidative stress such as 
4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine (8-oxo-dG) were
significantly increased, while fragile X-mental retardation protein (FMRP)
expression was decreased in the SD group. Interestingly, melatonin treatment
normalized these events to control levels following SD. Our data demonstrate that
SD induces oxidative stress through glial activation and decreases FMRP
expression in the neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest the efficacy of
melatonin for the treatment of sleep-related neuronal dysfunction, which occurs
in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and autism.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of intellectual
impairment as well as the leading monogenetic cause of autism. In addition to its
canonical definition as a neurodevelopmental disease, recent findings in the
clinic suggest that FXS is a systemic disorder that is characterized by a variety
of heterogeneous phenotypes. Efforts to study FXS pathogenesis have been aided by
the development and characterization of animal models of the disease. Research
efforts in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed key insights into the
mechanistic underpinnings of FXS. While much remains unknown, it is increasingly 
apparent that FXS involves a myriad of spatially and temporally specific
alterations in cellular function. Consequently, the literature is filled with
numerous discordant findings. Researchers and clinicians alike must be cognizant 
of this dissonance, as it will likely be important for the design of preclinical 
studies to assess the efficacy of therapeutic strategies to improve the lives of 
FXS patients.

BACKGROUND: Deep layer excitatory circuits in the prefrontal cortex represent the
strongest locus for genetic convergence in autism, but specific abnormalities
within these circuits that mediate key features of autism, such as cognitive or
attentional deficits, remain unknown. Attention normally increases the
sensitivity of neural populations to incoming signals by decorrelating ongoing
cortical circuit activity. Here, we investigated whether mechanisms underlying
this phenomenon might be disrupted within deep layer prefrontal circuits in mouse
models of autism.
METHODS: We isolated deep layer prefrontal circuits in brain slices then used
single-photon GCaMP imaging to record activity from many (50 to 100) neurons
simultaneously to study patterns of spontaneous activity generated by these
circuits under normal conditions and in two etiologically distinct models of
autism: mice exposed to valproic acid in utero and Fmr1 knockout mice.
RESULTS: We found that modest doses of the cholinergic agonist carbachol normally
decorrelate spontaneous activity generated by deep layer prefrontal networks.
This effect was disrupted in both valproic acid-exposed and Fmr1 knockout mice
but intact following other manipulations that did not model autism.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cholinergic modulation may contribute to
attention by acting on local cortical microcircuits to decorrelate spontaneous
activity. Furthermore, defects in this mechanism represent a microcircuit-level
endophenotype that could link diverse genetic and developmental disruptions to
attentional deficits in autism. Future studies could elucidate pathways leading
from various etiologies to this circuit-level abnormality or use this abnormality
itself as a target and identify novel therapeutic strategies that restore normal 
circuit function.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited intellectual disability often associated
with autism, is caused by the loss of expression of the fragile X mental
retardation protein. Tremendous progress in basic, preclinical, and translational
clinical research has elucidated a variety of molecular-, cellular-, and
system-level defects in FXS. This has led to the development of several promising
therapeutic strategies, some of which have been tested in larger-scale controlled
clinical trials. Here, we will summarize recent advances in understanding
molecular functions of fragile X mental retardation protein beyond the well-known
role as an mRNA-binding protein, and will describe current developments and
emerging limitations in the use of the FXS mouse model as a preclinical tool to
identify therapeutic targets. We will review the results of recent clinical
trials conducted in FXS that were based on some of the preclinical findings, and 
discuss how the observed outcomes and obstacles will inform future therapy
development in FXS and other autism spectrum disorders.

Silencing the gene FMR1 in fragile X syndrome (FXS) with consequent loss of its
protein product, FMRP, results in intellectual disability, hyperactivity,
anxiety, seizure disorders, and autism-like behavior. In a mouse model (Fmr1
knockout (KO)) of FXS, a deficit in performance on the passive avoidance test of 
learning and memory is a robust phenotype. We report that drugs acting on the
endocannabinoid (eCB) system can improve performance on this test. We present
three lines of evidence: (1) Propofol (reported to inhibit fatty acid amide
hydrolase (FAAH) activity) administered 30 min after training on the passive
avoidance test improved performance in Fmr1 KO mice but had no effect on wild
type (WT). FAAH catalyzes the metabolism of the eCB, anandamide, so its
inhibition should result in increased anandamide levels. (2) The effect of
propofol was blocked by prior administration of the cannabinoid receptor 1
antagonist AM-251. (3) Treatment with the FAAH inhibitor, URB-597, administered
30 min after training on the passive avoidance test also improved performance in 
Fmr1 KO mice but had no effect on WT. Our results indicate that the eCB system is
involved in FXS and suggest that the eCB system is a promising target for
treatment of FXS.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA binding protein with 842
target mRNAs in mammalian brain. Silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
(FMR1) gene leads to loss of expression of FMRP and upregulated metabotropic
glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling resulting in the multiple physical and
cognitive deficits associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Reduced FMRP
expression has been identified in subjects with autism, schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and major depression who do not carry the mutation for FMR1. Our
laboratory has recently demonstrated altered expression of four downstream
targets of FMRP-mGluR5 signaling in brains of subjects with autism: homer 1,
amyloid beta A4 precursor protein (APP), ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate
1 (RAC1), and striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). In the
current study we investigated the expression of the same four proteins in lateral
cerebella of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression 
and in frontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In
frontal cortex we observed: 1) reduced expression of 120 kDa form of APP in
subjects with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; 2) reduced expression of 61 kDa
and 33k Da forms of STEP in subjects with schizophrenia; 3) reduced expression of
88 kDa form of APP in subjects with bipolar disorder; and 3) trends for reduced
expression of 88 kDa form of APP and homer 1 in subjects with schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder, respectively. In lateral cerebella there was no group
difference, however we observed increased expression of RAC1 in subjects with
bipolar disorder, and trends for increased RAC1 in subjects with schizophrenia
and major depression. Our results provide further evidence that proteins involved
in the FMRP-mGluR5 signaling pathway are altered in schizophrenia and mood
disorders.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) affects individuals with more than 200 CGG repeats (full
mutation) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Those born with FXS 
experience cognitive and social impairments, developmental delays, and some
features of autism spectrum disorders. Carriers of a premutation (55-200 CGG
repeats) are generally not severely affected early in life; however, are at high 
risk of developing the late onset neurodegenerative disorder, Fragile
X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), or Fragile X-associated Primary
Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and may have other medical conditions such as
developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders, hypertension, anxiety, and
immune-mediated disorders. Here we present a case of a 58-year-old man with a
borderline IQ, average memory skills, and executive function deficits. He met
criteria for multiple psychiatric diagnoses and presented with tremor and ataxia,
meeting criteria for FXTAS. Molecular testing unveiled a completely unmethylated 
FMR1 full mutation in peripheral blood mononucleated cells with elevated FMR1
mRNA and premutation alleles of different sizes in two other tissues (primary
fibroblasts and sperm), indicating the presence of allele instability based on
both inter- and intra-tissue mosaicism. The observation of FXTAS in this case of 
a full mutation mosaic man suggests that the pathogenic mechanism underlying this
disorder is not observed exclusively in premutation carriers as it was originally
thought. The concomitant presence of features of FXS and late onset neurological 
deterioration with probable FXTAS likely result from a combined molecular
pathology of elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, a molecular hallmark of FXTAS and low
FMRP expression that leads to FXS.

Fragile X is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and a
leading cause of autism. The disease is caused by mutation of a single X-linked
gene called fmr1 that codes for the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), 
a 71 kDa protein, which acts mainly as a translation inhibitor. Fragile X
patients suffer from cognitive and emotional deficits that coincide with
abnormalities in dendritic spines. Changes in spine morphology are often
associated with altered excitatory transmission and long-term plasticity, the
most prominent deficit in fmr1-/y mice. The nucleus accumbens, a central part of 
the mesocortico-limbic reward pathway, is now considered as a core structure in
the control of social behaviors. Although the socio-affective impairments
observed in Fragile X suggest dysfunctions in the accumbens, the impact of the
lack of FMRP on accumbal synapses has scarcely been studied. Here we report for
the first time a new spike timing-dependent plasticity paradigm that reliably
triggers NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory afferent
inputs of medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the nucleus accumbens core region.
Notably, we discovered that this LTP was completely absent in fmr1-/y mice. In
the fmr1-/y accumbens intrinsic membrane properties of MSNs and basal excitatory 
neurotransmission remained intact in the fmr1-/y accumbens but the deficit in LTP
was accompanied by an increase in evoked AMPA/NMDA ratio and a concomitant
reduction of spontaneous NMDAR-mediated currents. In agreement with these
physiological findings, we found significantly more filopodial spines in fmr1-/y 
mice by using an ultrastructural electron microscopic analysis of accumbens core 
medium spiny neuron spines. Surprisingly, spine elongation was specifically due
to the longer longitudinal axis and larger area of spine necks, whereas spine
head morphology and postsynaptic density size on spine heads remained unaffected 
in the fmr1-/y accumbens. These findings together reveal new structural and
functional synaptic deficits in Fragile X.

Fragile X Syndrome, a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and
autism, arises from transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene encoding an
RNA-binding protein, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). FMRP can
regulate the expression of approximately 4% of brain transcripts through its role
in regulation of mRNA transport, stability and translation, thus providing a
molecular rationale for its potential pleiotropic effects on neuronal and brain
circuitry function. Several intracellular signaling pathways are dysregulated in 
the absence of FMRP suggesting that cellular deficits may be broad and could
result in homeostatic changes. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of the plasma 
membrane, enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, involved in regulation 
of intracellular signaling. Among transcripts targeted by FMRP, a subset encodes 
proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and homeostasis, dysregulation of which
could affect the integrity and function of lipid rafts. Using a quantitative mass
spectrometry-based approach we analyzed the lipid raft proteome of Fmr1 knockout 
mice, an animal model of Fragile X syndrome, and identified candidate proteins
that are differentially represented in Fmr1 knockout mice lipid rafts.
Furthermore, network analysis of these candidate proteins reveals connectivity
between them and predicts functional connectivity with genes encoding components 
of myelin sheath, axonal processes and growth cones. Our findings provide insight
to aid identification of molecular and cellular dysfunctions arising from Fmr1
silencing and for uncovering shared pathologies between Fragile X syndrome and
other autism spectrum disorders.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known monogenic form of autism and the
most common form of inherited intellectual disability. FXS results from silencing
the FMR1 gene during embryonic development, leading to loss of Fragile X Mental
Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA transport,
stability, and translation. FXS is commonly thought of as a disease of synaptic
dysfunction, however, FMRP expression is lost early in embryonic development,
well before most synaptogenesis occurs. Recent studies suggest that loss of FMRP 
results in aberrant neurogenesis, but neurogenic defects have been variable. We
investigated whether FMRP affects neurogenesis in Xenopus laevis tadpoles which
express a homolog of FMR1. We used in vivo time-lapse imaging of neural
progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny to evaluate the effect of acute loss 
or over-expression of FMRP on neurogenesis in the developing optic tectum. We
complimented the time-lapse studies with SYTOX labeling to quantify apoptosis and
CldU labeling to measure cell proliferation. Animals with increased or decreased 
levels of FMRP have significantly decreased neuronal proliferation and survival. 
They also have increased neuronal differentiation, but deficient dendritic arbor 
elaboration. The presence and severity of these defects was highly sensitive to
FMRP levels. These data demonstrate that FMRP plays an important role in
neurogenesis and suggest that endogenous FMRP levels are carefully regulated.
These studies show promise in using Xenopus as an experimental system to study
fundamental deficits in brain development with loss of FMRP and give new insight 
into the pathophysiology of FXS.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common known inherited form of
intellectual disability and the single genomic cause of autism spectrum
disorders. It is caused by the absence of a fragile X mental retardation gene
(Fmr1) product, FMRP, an RNA-binding translation suppressor. Elevated rates of
protein synthesis in the brain and an imbalance between synaptic signaling via
glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are both considered important in the
pathogenesis of FXS. In a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 knockout [KO]), treatment with
R-baclofen reversed some behavioral and biochemical phenotypes. A remaining
crucial question is whether R-baclofen is also able to reverse increased brain
protein synthesis rates.
METHODS: To answer this question, we measured regional rates of cerebral protein 
synthesis in vivo with the L-[1-(14)C]leucine method in vehicle- and
R-baclofen-treated wildtype and Fmr1 KO mice. We further probed signaling
pathways involved in the regulation of protein synthesis.
RESULTS: Acute R-baclofen administration corrected elevated protein synthesis and
reduced deficits on a test of social behavior in adult Fmr1 KO mice. It also
suppressed activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, particularly in
synaptosome-enriched fractions, but it had no effect on extracellular-regulated
kinase 1/2 activity. Ninety min after R-baclofen treatment, we observed an
increase in metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 expression in the frontal cortex, a
finding that may shed light on the tolerance observed in human studies with this 
drug.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that treatment via activation of the GABA (GABA 
receptor subtype B) system warrants further study in patients with FXS.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the epigenetic basis of psychiatric symptoms and
dysexecutive impairments in FMR1 premutation (PM: 55 to 199 CGG repeats) women.
METHODS: A total of 35 FMR1 PM women aged between 22 and 55 years and 35 age- and
IQ-matched women controls (CGG <45) participated in this study. All participants 
completed a range of executive function tests and self-reported symptoms of
psychiatric disorders. The molecular measures included DNA methylation of the
FMR1 CpG island in blood, presented as FMR1 activation ratio (AR), and 9 CpG
sites located at the FMR1 exon1/intron 1 boundary, CGG size, and FMR1 mRNA
levels.
RESULTS: We show that FMR1 intron 1 methylation levels could be used to
dichotomize PM women into greater and lower risk categories (p = 0.006 to 0.037; 
odds ratio = 14-24.8), with only FMR1 intron 1 methylation, and to a lesser
extent AR, being significantly correlated with the likelihood of probable
dysexecutive or psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the significant
relationships between methylation and social anxiety were found to be mediated by
executive function performance, but only in PM women. FMR1 exon 1 methylation,
CGG size, and FMR1 mRNA could not predict probable dysexecutive/psychiatric
disorders in PM women.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study supporting presence of specific epigenetic
etiology associated with increased risk of developing comorbid dysexecutive and
social anxiety symptoms in PM women. These findings could have implications for
early intervention and risk estimate recommendations aimed at improving the
outcomes for PM women and their families.

The activity-dependent refinement of neural circuit connectivity during critical 
periods of brain development is essential for optimized behavioral performance.
We hypothesize that this mechanism is defective in fragile X syndrome (FXS), the 
leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders.
Here, we use optogenetic tools in the Drosophila FXS disease model to test
activity-dependent dendritogenesis in two extrinsic neurons of the mushroom body 
(MB) learning and memory brain center: (1) the input projection neuron (PN)
innervating Kenyon cells (KCs) in the MB calyx microglomeruli and (2) the output 
MVP2 neuron innervated by KCs in the MB peduncle. Both input and output neuron
classes exhibit distinctive activity-dependent critical period dendritic
remodeling. MVP2 arbors expand in Drosophila mutants null for fragile X mental
retardation 1 (dfmr1), as well as following channelrhodopsin-driven
depolarization during critical period development, but are reduced by
halorhodopsin-driven hyperpolarization. Optogenetic manipulation of PNs causes
the opposite outcome--reduced dendritic arbors following channelrhodopsin
depolarization and expanded arbors following halorhodopsin hyperpolarization
during development. Importantly, activity-dependent dendritogenesis in both
neuron classes absolutely requires dfmr1 during one developmental window. These
results show that dfmr1 acts in a neuron type-specific activity-dependent manner 
for sculpting dendritic arbors during early-use, critical period development of
learning and memory circuitry in the Drosophila brain.

Previous research indicates that the GABAAergic system is involved in the
pathophysiology of the fragile X syndrome, a frequent form of inherited
intellectual disability and associated with autism spectrum disorder. However,
the molecular mechanism underlying GABAAergic deficits has remained largely
unknown. Here, we demonstrate reduced mRNA expression of GABAA receptor subunits 
in the cortex and cerebellum of young Fmr1 knockout mice. In addition, we show
that the previously reported underexpression of specific subunits of the GABAA
receptor can be corrected in YAC transgenic rescue mice, containing the
full-length human FMR1 gene in an Fmr1 knockout background. Moreover, we
demonstrate that FMRP directly binds several GABAA receptor mRNAs. Finally,
positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors with the neurosteroid
ganaxolone can modulate specific behaviors in Fmr1 knockout mice, emphasizing the
therapeutic potential of the receptor.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impaired ability to
properly implement environmental stimuli that are essential to achieve a state of
social and cultural exchange. Indeed, the main features of ASD are impairments of
interpersonal relationships, verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted
and repetitive behaviors. These aspects are often accompanied by several
comorbidities such as motor delay, praxis impairment, gait abnormalities,
insomnia, and above all epilepsy. Genetic analyses of autistic individuals
uncovered deleterious mutations in several K(+) channel types strengthening the
notion that their intrinsic dysfunction may play a central etiologic role in ASD.
However, indirect implication of K(+) channels in ASD has been also reported. For
instance, loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in K(+)
channels deregulation, network dysfunction and ASD-like cognitive and behavioral 
symptoms. This review provides an update on direct and indirect implications of
K(+) channels in ASDs. Owing to a mounting body of evidence associating a
channelopathy pathogenesis to autism and showing that nearly 500 ion channel
proteins are encoded by the human genome, we propose to classify ASDs - whose
susceptibility is significantly enhanced by ion channels defects, either in a
monogenic or multigenic condition - in a new category named " c hannel A utism S 
pectrum D isorder" (channelASD; cASD) and introduce a new taxonomy (e.g., Kv
x.y-channelASD and likewise Nav x.y-channelASD, Cav x.y-channelASD; etc.). This
review also highlights some degree of clinical and genetic overlap between K(+)
channelASDs and K(+) channelepsies, whereby such correlation suggests that a
subcategory characterized by a channelASD-channelepsy phenotype may be
distinguished. Ultimately, this overview aims to further understand the different
clinical subgroups and help parse out the distinct biological basis of autism
that are essential to establish patient-tailored treatments.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disease due to a CGG trinucleotide
expansion, named full mutation (greater than 200 CGG repeats), in the fragile X
mental retardation 1 gene locus Xq27.3; which leads to an hypermethylated region 
in the gene promoter therefore silencing it and lowering the expression levels of
the fragile X mental retardation 1, a protein involved in synaptic plasticity and
maturation. Individuals with FXS present with intellectual disability, autism,
hyperactivity, long face, large or prominent ears and macroorchidism at puberty
and thereafter. Most of the young children with FXS will present with language
delay, sensory hyper arousal and anxiety. Girls are less affected than boys, only
25% have intellectual disability. Given the genomic features of the syndrome,
there are patients with a number of triplet repeats between 55 and 200, known as 
premutation carriers. Most carriers have a normal IQ but some have developmental 
problems. The diagnosis of FXS has evolved from karyotype with special culture
medium, to molecular techniques that are more sensitive and specific including
PCR and Southern Blot. During the last decade, the advances in the knowledge of
FXS, has led to the development of investigations on pharmaceutical management or
targeted treatments for FXS. Minocycline and sertraline have shown efficacy in
children.

Publisher: El Síndrome de X Frágil (SXF), es una enfermedad genética debida a una
expansión del trinucleótido CGG, nombrada mutación completa (más de 200
repeticiones de CGG) en el locus Xq27.3 del gen X fragil de retardo mental; la
cual lleva a una hipermetilación de la región promotora del gen, silenciándolo y 
disminuyendo los niveles de expresión de la proteína X frágil de retardo mental
1, relacionada con la plasticidad y maduración neuronal. Los individuos con SXF
presentan retardo mental, autismo, hiperactividad, cara alargada, orejas grandes 
o prominentes y macroorquidismo desde la pubertad. La mayoría de niños con SXF
presentan retraso en el lenguaje, hiperactivación sensorial y ansiedad. Las niñas
se afectan menos que los varones, solo el 25% presenta retardo mental. Dadas las 
características genómicas del síndrome, existen pacientes con un número de
repetición de la tripleta entre 55 y 200 que se denominan portadores de la
premutación. La mayoría de los portadores tienen un coeficiente intelectual
normal, pero presentan problemas en el desarrollo. El diagnóstico en SXF ha
evolucionado del cariotipo con medio especial de cultivo, a pruebas moleculares
más sensibles y específicas incluyendo PCR y Southern blot. Durante la última
década, los avances en el conocimiento sobre el SXF han permitido el desarrollo
de investigaciones sobre el manejo farmacológico o tratamientos específicos para 
el SXF. La minociclina y la sertralina han demostrado eficacia en niños.

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to test a new approach to drug treatment of
autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the Fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mouse model.
METHODS: We used behavioral analysis, mass spectrometry, metabolomics, electron
microscopy, and western analysis to test the hypothesis that the disturbances in 
social behavior, novelty preference, metabolism, and synapse structure are
treatable with antipurinergic therapy (APT).
RESULTS: Weekly treatment with the purinergic antagonist suramin (20 mg/kg
intraperitoneally), started at 9 weeks of age, restored normal social behavior,
and improved metabolism, and brain synaptosomal structure. Abnormalities in
synaptosomal glutamate, endocannabinoid, purinergic, and IP3 receptor expression,
complement C1q, TDP43, and amyloid β precursor protein (APP) were corrected.
Comprehensive metabolomic analysis identified 20 biochemical pathways associated 
with symptom improvements. Seventeen pathways were shared with human ASD, and 11 
were shared with the maternal immune activation (MIA) model of ASD. These
metabolic pathways were previously identified as functionally related mediators
of the evolutionarily conserved cell danger response (CDR).
CONCLUSIONS: The data show that antipurinergic therapy improves the multisystem, 
ASD-like features of both the environmental MIA, and the genetic Fragile X
models. These abnormalities appeared to be traceable to mitochondria and
regulated by purinergic signaling.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder, is the most prevalent
single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. Autism has been associated with
impaired auditory processing, abnormalities in the auditory brainstem response
(ABR), and reduced cell number and size in the auditory brainstem nuclei. FXS is 
characterized by elevated cortical responses to sound stimuli, with some evidence
for aberrant ABRs. Here, we assessed ABRs and auditory brainstem anatomy in
Fmr1-/- mice, an animal model of FXS. We found that Fmr1-/- mice showed elevated 
response thresholds to both click and tone stimuli. Amplitudes of ABR responses
were reduced in Fmr1-/- mice for early peaks of the ABR. The growth of the peak I
response with sound intensity was less steep in mutants that in wild type mice.
In contrast, amplitudes and response growth in peaks IV and V did not differ
between these groups. We did not observe differences in peak latencies or in
interpeak latencies. Cell size was reduced in Fmr1-/- mice in the ventral
cochlear nucleus (VCN) and in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We
quantified levels of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in these nuclei
using markers for presynaptic proteins. We measured VGAT and VGLUT immunolabeling
in VCN, MNTB, and the lateral superior olive (LSO). VGAT expression in MNTB was
significantly greater in the Fmr1-/- mouse than in wild type mice. Together,
these observations demonstrate that FXS affects peripheral and central aspects of
hearing and alters the balance of excitation and inhibition in the auditory
brainstem.

Fragile X syndrome as a rare disease in China - Therapeutic challenges and
opportunities.

Jin X(1), Chen L(1).

Author information: 
(1)Hua Medicine, Shanghai, China.

Recognized as the most common inherited from of intellectual disability (ID) and 
the most common known monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Fragile
X syndrome (FXS) is identified as an unmet medical need for the development of
personalized medicine and targeted therapeutics for neurodevelopment disorders as
a result of improved understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms.
Consequently promising pharmacological targets have emerged from basic and
translational research, are now being pursued by global pharmaceutical and
biotech companies in early proof-of-concept clinical trials. With the world's
largest rare disease population, China potentially has a large number of FXS
patients, many of whom are under-diagnosed or even misdiagnosed, barely with any 
treatment. In spite of improved awareness of FXS in recent years, big gaps still 
exist between China and developed countries in multiple aspects. With increased
public awareness, strong government support and investment, coupled with an
increasingly large number of Western-trained experienced researchers engaging in 
new drug discovery and development, China has the potential to become an
important player in the discovery of effective diagnostics and treatments for a
rare disease like FXS.

The Dual-specify tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene has
been extensively studied for its role in the pathophysiology of intellectual
disability (ID) in Down syndrome. The rise of next generation sequencing (NGS)
and array-CGH (aCGH) in diagnostic settings for the evaluation of patients with
ID allowed the identification of 17 patients carrying heterozygous genetic
aberrations involving DYRK1A to date. The rate of DYRK1A mutations in this
population reaches >1% in published NGS studies. The current report aims at
further defining the phenotype of this encephalopathy with the detailed report of
two unrelated patients. Both patients were boys with developmental delay, febrile
seizures, facial dysmorphism and brain atrophy on MRI. Patient #1 had autistic
behaviors and micropenis and Patient #2 had stereotypies and microcephaly. NGS
analyses identified heterozygous de novo variants in DYRK1A: the c.613C >T
(p.Arg205*) nonsense mutation in Patient #1 and the c.932C >T (p.Ser311Phe)
missense mutation in Patient #2. Together with previously reported cases,
patients with DYRK1A mutations share many clinical features and may have a
recognizable phenotype that includes, by decreasing order of frequency:
developmental delay or ID with behaviors suggesting autism spectrum disorder,
microcephaly, epileptic seizures, facial dysmorphism including ear anomalies
(large ears, hypoplastic lobes), thin lips, short philtrum and frontal bossing.
Delineation of the phenotype/genotype correlation is not feasible at the moment
and will be a challenge for the coming years.

The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), which codes for the fragile X
mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP), is located at Xp27.3. The normal allele of
the FMR1 gene typically has 5 to 40 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region;
abnormal alleles of dynamic mutations include the full mutation (> 200 CGG
repeats), premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) and the gray zone mutation (45-54 CGG 
repeats). Premutation carriers are common in the general population with
approximately 1 in 130-250 females and 1 in 250-810 males, whereas the full
mutation and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) occur in approximately 1 in 4000 to 1 in
7000. FMR1 mutations account for a variety of phenotypes including the most
common monogenetic cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism
(FXS), the most common genetic form of ovarian failure, the fragile X-associated 
primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI, premutation); and fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS, premutation). The premutation can also cause
developmental problems including ASD and ADHD especially in boys and
psychopathology including anxiety and depression in children and adults. Some
premutation carriers can have a deficit of FMRP and some unmethylated full
mutation individuals can have elevated FMR1 mRNA that is considered a premutation
problem. Therefore the term "Fragile X Spectrum Disorder" (FXSD) should be used
to include the wide range of overlapping phenotypes observed in affected
individuals with FMR1 mutations. In this review we focus on the phenotypes and
genotypes of children with FXSD.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a commonly inherited form of intellectual disability 
and one of the leading genetic causes for autism spectrum disorder. Clinical
symptoms of FXS can include impaired cognition, anxiety, hyperactivity, social
phobia, and repetitive behaviors. FXS is caused by a CGG repeat mutation which
expands a region on the X chromosome containing the FMR1 gene. In FXS, a full
mutation (> 200 repeats) leads to hypermethylation of FMR1, an epigenetic
mechanism that effectively silences FMR1 gene expression and reduces levels of
the FMR1 gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an
RNA-binding protein that is important for the regulation of protein expression.
In an effort to further understand how loss of FMR1 and FMRP contribute to FXS
symptomology, several FXS animal models have been created. The most well
characterized rodent model is the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse, which lacks FMRP
protein due to a disruption in its Fmr1 gene. Here, we review the behavioral
phenotyping of the Fmr1 KO mouse to date, and discuss the clinical relevance of
this mouse model to the human FXS condition. While much remains to be learned
about FXS, the Fmr1 KO mouse is a valuable tool for understanding the
repercussions of functional loss of FMRP and assessing the efficacy of
pharmacological compounds in ameliorating the molecular and behavioral phenotypes
relevant to FXS.

Treatment of the psychiatric problems associated with fragile X syndrome.

bDepartment of Pediatrics, University of California Davis Health System,
Sacramento, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This work reviews recent research regarding treatment of
fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability and autism spectrum disorder. The phenotype includes anxiety linked to
sensory hyperarousal, hyperactivity, and attentional problems consistent with
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and social deficits leading to autism
spectrum disorder in 60% of boys and 25% of girls with FXS.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple targeted treatments for FXS have rescued the phenotype 
of the fmr1 knockout mouse, but few have been beneficial to patients with FXS.
The failure of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists falls on the
heels of the failure of Arbaclofen's efficacy in children and adults with autism 
or FXS. In contrast, efficacy has been demonstrated in a controlled trial of
minocycline in children with FXS. Minocycline lowers the abnormally elevated
levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in FXS. Acamprosate and lovastatin have been
beneficial in open-label trials in FXS. The first 5 years of life may be the most
efficacious time for intervention when combined with behavioral and/or
educational interventions.
SUMMARY: Minocycline, acamprosate, lovastatin, and sertraline are treatments that
can be currently prescribed and have shown benefit in children with FXS. Use of
combined medical and behavioral interventions will likely be most efficacious for
the treatment of FXS.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common monogenetic form of intellectual disability
and autism. Although the Fmr1 knockout mouse model recapitulates many aspects of 
the human FXS condition, the establishment of robust social behavioural
phenotypes suitable for drug screening has been difficult. Here, we describe a
novel social behavioural paradigm, the Automated Tube Test (ATT), for which Fmr1 
knockout mice demonstrate a highly reliable and robust phenotype. Fmr1 KO mice
show highly dominant behaviour over wild-type littermates in the ATT. Consistent 
with previous findings, we observed a highly significant, albeit partial, rescue 
of the altered social behaviour of Fmr1 knockout mice in the ATT, using genetic
(mGluR5 deletion) or pharmacological inhibition (mGluR5 antagonist) of mGluR5
signalling independently. Together, our results validate the Automated Tube Test 
as a robust outcome measure for social behaviour in preclinical research for FXS,
and confirm the pathophysiological relevance of mGluR5 signalling. Moreover, our 
findings highlight the strategy of initiating pharmacological intervention in
adulthood as holding significant clinical potential.

Recent studies in young adult females with the fragile X mental retardation 1
(FMR1) gene premutation (PM) have shown subtle but significant impairments in
executive control and postural stability. Less is known about the influence of
age and FMR1 gene expression on executive control and postural stability in
females with the PM. Here, we examined the attentional demands of reactive
stepping using a well-validated measure of choice stepping reaction time under
dual-task interference. We explored the interrelationships between step
initiation times during a concurrent verbal fluency task and specific impairments
in executive control previously reported in females with the PM. Our results
showed increased dual-task interference on step initiation times and variability 
in female PM compared with control subjects. In addition, we observed greater
choice stepping reaction time dual-task costs above the breakpoint of 81 CGG
repeats relative to below this CGG range. Dual-task interference on both reaction
time and movement time were significantly predicted by low working memory
capacity in female PM carriers. Importantly, we revealed that FMR1 messenger RNA 
level is the most significant predictor accounting for dual-task stepping
variability in both reaction time and movement time in PM females. These findings
for the first time provide evidence linking elevated FMR1 messenger RNA levels
that have been previously associated with FMR1 RNA toxicity and deficits in
cerebellar motor and cognitive networks in a subgroup of at-risk PM women.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability, is associated with a broad spectrum of disorders across different
generations of a single family. This study reviews the clinical manifestations of
fragile X-associated disorders as well as the spectrum of mutations of the
fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) and the neurobiology of the fragile X 
mental retardation protein (FMRP), and also provides an overview of the potential
therapeutic targets and genetic counselling.
DEVELOPMENT: This disorder is caused by expansion of the CGG repeat (>200
repeats) in the 5 prime untranslated region of FMR1, resulting in a deficit or
absence of FMRP. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of
several genes that are important in synaptic plasticity and dendritic maturation.
It is believed that CGG repeat expansions in the premutation range (55 to 200
repeats) elicit an increase in mRNA levels of FMR1, which may cause neuronal
toxicity. These changes manifest clinically as developmental problems such as
autism and learning disabilities as well as neurodegenerative diseases including 
fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
CONCLUSIONS: Advances in identifying the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome
may help us understand the causes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and they will
probably contribute to development of new and specific treatments.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder with a broad
spectrum of involvement, including cognitive and behavioural impairments of
varying degrees with specific physical features and a strong association with
autism.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, the frequency of serum anti-neural antibodies was
investigated in FXS patients who did and those who did not manifest autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) in comparison to typically developing controls.
METHODS: The study involved 23 males (mean age, 19.78 ± 6.56 years) who harboured
a full mutation in the FMR1 gene. The control group comprised 19 healthy students
(mean age 24.63 ± 1.89 years). Serum anti-neuronal antibodies were analyzed using
Western blotting.
RESULTS: Serum anti-neuronal antibodies were present in 10/23 (43.48%) FXS males.
CONCLUSION: Serum anti-neuronal antibodies were found in a subgroup of FXS
patients. Autistic symptoms in FXS may, in part, be caused by auto-immune
factors. Further studies in larger patient and control groups are necessary to
elucidate the aetiopathogenic role of anti-neuronal antibodies in FXS patients.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset
neurodegenerative disorder associated with premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene
that is characterized by progressive action tremor, gait ataxia, and cognitive
decline. Recent studies of mitochondrial dysfunction in FXTAS have suggested that
iron dysregulation may be one component of disease pathogenesis. We tested the
hypothesis that iron dysregulation is part of the pathogenic process in FXTAS. We
analyzed postmortem choroid plexus from FXTAS and control subjects, and found
that in FXTAS iron accumulated in the stroma, transferrin levels were decreased
in the epithelial cells, and transferrin receptor 1 distribution was shifted from
the basolateral membrane (control) to a predominantly intracellular location
(FXTAS). In addition, ferroportin and ceruloplasmin were markedly decreased
within the epithelial cells. These alterations have implications not only for
understanding the pathophysiology of FXTAS, but also for the development of new
clinical treatments that may incorporate selective iron chelation.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading genetic cause of autism. Mutations in
Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1 gene) engender exaggerated translation
resulting in dendritic spine dysmorphogenesis, synaptic plasticity alterations,
and behavioral deficits in mice, which are reminiscent of FXS phenotypes. Using
postmortem brains from FXS patients and Fmr1 knockout mice (Fmr1(-/y)), we show
that phosphorylation of the mRNA 5' cap binding protein, eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E (eIF4E), is elevated concomitant with increased expression of matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) protein. Genetic or pharmacological reduction of
eIF4E phosphorylation rescued core behavioral deficits, synaptic plasticity
alterations, and dendritic spine morphology defects via reducing exaggerated
translation of Mmp9 mRNA in Fmr1(-/y) mice, whereas MMP-9 overexpression produced
several FXS-like phenotypes. These results uncover a mechanism of regulation of
synaptic function by translational control of Mmp-9 in FXS, which opens the
possibility of new treatment avenues for the diverse neurological and psychiatric
aspects of FXS.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
brain. GABAergic receptor abnormalities have been documented in several major
psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism.
Abnormal expression of mRNA and protein for multiple GABA receptors has also been
observed in multiple brain regions leading to alterations in the balance between 
excitatory/inhibitory signaling in the brain with potential profound consequences
for normal cognition and maintenance of mood and perception. Altered expression
of GABAA receptor subunits has been documented in fragile X mental retardation 1 
(FMR1) knockout mice, suggesting that loss of its protein product, fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP), impacts GABAA subunit expression. Recent
postmortem studies from our laboratory have shown reduced expression of FMRP in
the brains of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression,
and autism. FMRP acts as a translational repressor and, under normal conditions, 
inhibits metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated signaling. In
fragile X syndrome (FXS), the absence of FMRP is hypothesized to lead to
unregulated mGluR5 signaling, ultimately resulting in the behavioral and
intellectual impairments associated with this disorder. Our laboratory has
identified changes in mGluR5 expression in autism, schizophrenia, and mood
disorders. In the current review article, we discuss our postmortem data on GABA 
receptors, FMRP, and mGluR5 levels and compare our results with other
laboratories. Finally, we discuss the interactions between these molecules and
the potential for new therapeutic interventions that target these interconnected 
signaling systems.

Silencing of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and loss of fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP) cause fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic
disorder characterized by intellectual disability and autistic behaviors. FMRP is
an mRNA-binding protein regulating neuronal translation of target mRNAs.
Abnormalities in actin-rich dendritic spines are major neuronal features in FXS, 
but the molecular mechanism and identity of FMRP targets mediating this phenotype
remain largely unknown. Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) was
identified as an interactor of FMRP, and its mRNA is a highly ranked FMRP target 
in mouse brain. Importantly, Cyfip2 is a component of WAVE regulatory complex, a 
key regulator of actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that Cyfip2 could be implicated
in the dendritic spine phenotype of FXS. Here, we generated and characterized
Cyfip2-mutant (Cyfip2(+/-)) mice. We found that Cyfip2(+/-) mice exhibited
behavioral phenotypes similar to Fmr1-null (Fmr1(-/y)) mice, an animal model of
FXS. Synaptic plasticity and dendritic spines were normal in Cyfip2(+/-)
hippocampus. However, dendritic spines were altered in Cyfip2(+/-) cortex, and
the dendritic spine phenotype of Fmr1(-/y) cortex was aggravated in Fmr1(-/y);
Cyfip2(+/-) double-mutant mice. In addition to the spine changes at basal state, 
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-induced dendritic spine regulation was
impaired in both Fmr1(-/y) and Cyfip2(+/-) cortical neurons. Mechanistically,
mGluR activation induced mRNA translation-dependent increase of Cyfip2 in
wild-type cortical neurons, but not in Fmr1(-/y) or Cyfip2(+/-) neurons. These
results suggest that misregulation of Cyfip2 function and its mGluR-induced
expression contribute to the neurobehavioral phenotypes of FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is associated with intellectual disability and
behavioral dysfunction, including anxiety, ADHD symptoms, and autistic features. 
Although individuals with FXS are largely considered healthy and lifespan is not 
thought to be reduced, very little is known about the long-term medical health of
adults with FXS and no systematically collected information is available on
standard laboratory measures from metabolic screens. During the course of follow 
up of a large cohort of patients with FXS we noted that many patients had low
cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) values and thus initiated a
systematic chart review of all cholesterol values present in charts from a clinic
cohort of over 500 patients with FXS. Total cholesterol (TC), low density
lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL were all significantly reduced in males from the FXS
cohort relative to age-adjusted population normative data. This finding has
relevance for health monitoring in individuals with FXS, for treatments with
cholesterol-lowering agents that have been proposed to target the underlying CNS 
disorder in FXS based on work in animal models, and for potential biomarker
development in FXS.

Despite the significance of efforts to understand the biological basis of autism,
progress in this area has been hindered, in part, by the considerable
heterogeneity in the disorder. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a monogenic condition
associated with high risk for autism, may pave the way for the dissection of
biological heterogeneity within idiopathic autism. This article adopts a
cross-syndrome biomarker approach to evaluate potentially overlapping profiles of
cardiac arousal dysregulation (and broader autonomic dysfunction) in autism and
FXS. Approaches such as this, aimed at delineating shared mechanisms across
genetic syndromes, hold great potential for improving diagnostic precision,
promoting earlier identification, and uncovering key systems that can be targeted
in pharmaceutical/behavioral interventions. Biomarker approaches may be vital to 
deconstructing complex psychiatric disorders and are currently promoted as such
by major research initiatives such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC).
Evidence reviewed here supports physiological dysregulation in a subset of
individuals with autism, as evidenced by patterns of hyperarousal and dampened
parasympathetic vagal tone that overlap with the well-documented physiological
profile of FXS. Moreover, there is growing support for a link between aberrant
cardiac activity and core deficits associated with autism, such as communication 
and social impairment. The delineation of physiological mechanisms common to
autism and FXS could lend insight into relationships between genetic etiology and
behavioral endstates, highlighting FMR1 as a potential candidate gene. Research
gaps and potential pitfalls are discussed to inform timely, well-controlled
biomarker research that will ultimately promote better diagnosis and treatment of
autism and associated conditions.

Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability and autism, is due 
to mutational silencing of the FMR1 gene leading to the absence of its gene
product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is a selective RNA
binding protein owing to two central K-homology domains and a C-terminal
arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) box. However, several properties of the FMRP amino
terminus are unresolved. It has been documented for over a decade that the amino 
terminus has the ability to bind RNA despite having no recognizable functional
motifs. Moreover, the amino terminus has recently been shown to bind chromatin
and influence the DNA damage response as well as function in the presynaptic
space, modulating action potential duration. We report here the amino terminal
crystal structures of wild-type FMRP, and a mutant (R138Q) that disrupts the
amino terminus function, containing an integral tandem Agenet and discover a
novel KH motif.

Hypersensitivity in response to sensory stimuli and neocortical hyperexcitability
are prominent features of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorders,
but little is known about the dendritic mechanisms underlying these phenomena. We
found that the primary somatosensory neocortex (S1) was hyperexcited in response 
to tactile sensory stimulation in Fmr1(-/y) mice. This correlated with neuronal
and dendritic hyperexcitability of S1 pyramidal neurons, which affect all major
aspects of neuronal computation, from the integration of synaptic input to the
generation of action potential output. Using dendritic electrophysiological
recordings, calcium imaging, pharmacology, biochemistry and a computer model, we 
found that this defect was, at least in part, attributable to the reduction and
dysfunction of dendritic h- and BKCa channels. We pharmacologically rescued
several core hyperexcitability phenomena by targeting BKCa channels. Our results 
provide strong evidence pointing to the utility of BKCa channel openers for the
treatment of the sensory hypersensitivity aspects of FXS.

Converging lines of evidence support the use of environmental stimulation to
ameliorate the symptoms of a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Applying
these interventions at very early ages is critical to achieve a marked reduction 
of the pathological phenotypes. Here we evaluated the impact of early social
enrichment in Fmr1-KO mice, a genetic mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a 
major developmental disorder and the most frequent monogenic cause of autism.
Enrichment was achieved by providing male KO pups and their WT littermates with
enhanced social stimulation, housing them from birth until weaning with the
mother and an additional nonlactating female. At adulthood they were tested for
locomotor, social, and cognitive abilities; furthermore, dendritic alterations
were assessed in the hippocampus and amygdala, two brain regions known to be
involved in the control of the examined behaviors and affected by spine pathology
in Fmr1-KOs. Enrichment rescued the behavioral FXS-like deficits displayed in
adulthood by Fmr1-KO mice, that is, hyperactivity, reduced social interactions,
and cognitive deficits. Early social enrichment also eliminated the abnormalities
shown by adult KO mice in the morphology of hippocampal and amygdala dendritic
spines, namely an enhanced density of immature vs mature types. Importantly,
enrichment did not induce neurobehavioral changes in WT mice, thus supporting
specific effects on FXS-like pathology. These findings show that early
environmental stimulation has profound and long-term beneficial effects on the
pathological FXS phenotype, thereby encouraging the use of nonpharmacological
interventions for the treatment of this and perhaps other neurodevelopmental
diseases.

Rare maternally inherited duplications at 15q11-13 are observed in ~1% of
individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), making it among the most
common causes of ASD. 15q11-13 comprises a complex region, and as this copy
number variation encompasses many genes, it is important to explore individual
genotype-phenotype relationships. Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1)
is of particular interest because of its interaction with Fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP), its upregulation in transformed lymphoblastoid cell
lines from patients with duplications at 15q11-13 and ASD and the presence of
smaller overlapping deletions of CYFIP1 in patients with schizophrenia and
intellectual disability. Here, we confirm that CYFIP1 is upregulated in
transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and demonstrate its upregulation in the
post-mortem brain from 15q11-13 duplication patients for the first time. To
investigate how increased CYFIP1 dosage might predispose to neurodevelopmental
disease, we studied the consequence of its overexpression in multiple systems. We
show that overexpression of CYFIP1 results in morphological abnormalities
including cellular hypertrophy in SY5Y cells and differentiated mouse neuronal
progenitors. We validate these results in vivo by generating a BAC transgenic
mouse, which overexpresses Cyfip1 under the endogenous promotor, observing an
increase in the proportion of mature dendritic spines and dendritic spine
density. Gene expression profiling on embryonic day 15 suggested the
dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which was
confirmed at the protein level. Importantly, similar evidence of mTOR-related
dysregulation was seen in brains from 15q11-13 duplication patients with ASD.
Finally, treatment of differentiated mouse neuronal progenitors with an mTOR
inhibitor (rapamycin) rescued the morphological abnormalities resulting from
CYFIP1 overexpression. Together, these data show that CYFIP1 overexpression
results in specific cellular phenotypes and implicate modulation by mTOR
signaling, further emphasizing its role as a potential convergent pathway in some
forms of ASD.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies have demonstrated the contribution of de
novo loss-of-function single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). However, challenges in the reliable detection of de novo
insertions and deletions (indels) have limited inclusion of these variants in
prior analyses. By applying a robust indel detection method to WES data from 787 
ASD families (2,963 individuals), we demonstrate that de novo frameshift indels
contribute to ASD risk (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0-2.7; p = 0.03), are more common in
female probands (p = 0.02), are enriched among genes encoding FMRP targets (p = 6
× 10(-9)), and arise predominantly on the paternal chromosome (p < 0.001). On the
basis of mutation rates in probands versus unaffected siblings, we conclude that 
de novo frameshift indels contribute to risk in approximately 3% of individuals
with ASD. Finally, by observing clustering of mutations in unrelated probands, we
uncover two ASD-associated genes: KMT2E (MLL5), a chromatin regulator, and RIMS1,
a regulator of synaptic vesicle release.

Expansions of more than 200 CGG repeats (full mutation) in the FMR1 gene give
rise to fragile X syndrome (FXS) through a process that generally involves
hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter region and gene silencing, resulting in
absence of expression of the encoded protein, FMRP. However, mosaicism with
alleles differing in size and extent of methylation often exist within or between
tissues of individuals with FXS. In the current work, CGG-repeat lengths and
methylation status were assessed for eighteen individuals with FXS, including 13 
mosaics, for which peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) and primary fibroblast cells
were available. Our results show that for both PBMCs and fibroblasts, FMR1 mRNA
and FMRP expression are directly correlated with the percent of methylation of
the FMR1 allele. In addition, Full Scale IQ scores were inversely correlated with
the percent methylation and positively correlated with higher FMRP expression.
These latter results point toward a positive impact on cognition for full
mutation mosaics with lower methylation compared to individuals with fully
methylated, full mutation alleles. However, we did not observe a significant
reduction in the number of seizures, nor in the severity of hyperactivity or
autism spectrum disorder, among individuals with mosaic genotypes in the
presentation of FXS. These observations suggest that low, but non-zero expression
of FMRP may be sufficient to positively impact cognitive function in individuals 
with FXS, with methylation mosaicism (lowered methylation fraction) contributing 
to a more positive clinical outcome.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who have an identifiable
single-gene neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), such as fragile X syndrome (FXS,
FMR1), Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS, RAI1), or 2q23.1 deletion syndrome (del
2q23.1, MBD5) share phenotypic features, including a high prevalence of sleep
disturbance. We describe the circadian deficits in del 2q23.1 through caregiver
surveys in which we identify several frequent sleep anomalies, including
night/early awakenings, coughing/snoring loudly, and difficulty falling asleep.
We couple these findings with studies on the molecular analysis of the circadian 
deficits associated with haploinsufficiency of MBD5 in which circadian gene mRNA 
levels of NR1D2, PER1, PER2, and PER3 were altered in del 2q23.1 lymphoblastoid
cell lines (LCLs), signifying that haploinsufficiency of MBD5 can result in
dysregulation of circadian rhythm gene expression. These findings were further
supported by expression microarrays of MBD5 siRNA knockdown cells that showed
significantly altered expression of additional circadian rhythm signaling pathway
genes. Based on the common sleep phenotypes observed in del 2q23.1, SMS, and FXS 
patients, we explored the possibility that MBD5, RAI1, and FMR1 function in
overlapping circadian rhythm pathways. Bioinformatic analysis identified
conserved putative E boxes in MBD5 and RAI1, and expression levels of NR1D2 and
CRY2 were significantly reduced in patient LCLs. Circadian and mTOR signaling
pathways, both associated with sleep disturbance, were altered in both MBD5 and
RAI1 knockdown microarray data, overlapping with findings associated with FMR1.
These data support phenotypic and molecular overlaps across these syndromes that 
may be exploited to provide therapeutic intervention for multiple disorders.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual
disability and the most common single-gene cause of autism. It is caused by
mutations on the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) and lack of fragile X
mental retardation protein, which in turn, leads to decreased inhibition of
translation of many synaptic proteins. The metabotropic glutamate receptor
(mGluR) hypothesis states that the neurological deficits in individuals with FXS 
are due mainly to downstream consequences of overstimulation of the mGluR
pathway. The main efforts have focused on mGluR5 targeted treatments; however,
investigation on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system and its potential as a
targeted treatment is less emphasized. The fragile X mouse models (Fmr1-knock
out) show decreased GABA subunit receptors, decreased synthesis of GABA,
increased catabolism of GABA, and overall decreased GABAergic input in many
regions of the brain. Consequences of the reduced GABAergic input in FXS include 
oversensitivity to sensory stimuli, seizures, and anxiety. Deficits in the GABA
receptors in different regions of the brain are associated with behavioral and
attentional processing deficits linked to anxiety and autistic behaviors. The
understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has led to the development of targeted
treatments for the core behavioral features of FXS, which include social
deficits, inattention, and anxiety. These symptoms are also observed in
individuals with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, therefore the
targeted treatments for FXS are leading the way in the treatment of other
neurodevelopmental syndromes and autism. The GABAergic system in FXS represents a
target for new treatments. Herein, we discuss the animal and human trials of
GABAergic treatment in FXS. Arbaclofen and ganaxolone have been used in
individuals with FXS. Other potential GABAergic treatments, such as riluzole,
gaboxadol, tiagabine, and vigabatrin, will be also discussed. Further studies are
needed to determine the safety and efficacy of GABAergic treatments for FXS.

We present a male patient with sporadic Aarskog syndrome, cleft palate, mild
intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A submicroscopic
discontiguous deletion was detected on chromosome Xp11.2 encompassing FGD1,
FAM120C, and PHF8. That the deletion encompassed FGD1 (exons 2-8) explains the
Aarskog features while the deletion of PHF8 most likely explains the cleft palate
and mild intellectual disability. We identify FAM120C as a novel X-linked
candidate gene for autism for two reasons: first, a larger deletion encompassing 
FAM120C segregates with autism in a previously reported family and second, there 
is recent evidence that FAM120C interacts with CYFIP1, part of the FMRP (Fragile 
X Mental Retardation Protein) network. In the current study, resequencing of
FAM120C in 87 Belgian male patients with autism spectrum disorder identified no
novel mutations. Expression of Fam120c in mouse tissues showed enriched
expression in pituitary, cerebellum, cortex, and pancreatic islets of Langerhans.
Additionally, we found a cortical expression pattern of Fam120c similar to that
of Fmr1. In conclusion, FAM120C is a novel candidate gene for autism spectrum
disorder based on genetic evidence and the brain expression pattern. Thereby we
highlight a role for FMRP network genes in ASD.

The Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited mental
disability and is considered a monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS
is caused by a triplet expansion that inhibits the expression of the FMR1 gene.
The gene product, the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), regulates mRNA
metabolism in brain and nonneuronal cells. During brain development, FMRP
controls the expression of key molecules involved in receptor signaling,
cytoskeleton remodeling, protein synthesis and, ultimately, spine morphology.
Symptoms associated with FXS include neurodevelopmental delay, cognitive
impairment, anxiety, hyperactivity, and autistic-like behavior. Twenty years ago 
the first Fmr1 KO mouse to study FXS was generated, and several years later other
key models including the mutant Drosophila melanogaster, dFmr1, have further
helped the understanding of the cellular and molecular causes behind this complex
syndrome. Here, we review to which extent these biological models are affected by
the absence of FMRP, pointing out the similarities with the observed human
dysfunction. Additionally, we discuss several potential treatments under study in
animal models that are able to partially revert some of the FXS abnormalities.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of inherited intellectual
disability and autism. It is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP),
an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of translation of a subset of
brain mRNAs. In Fmr1 knockout mice, the absence of FMRP results in elevated
protein synthesis in the brain as well as increased signaling of many
translational regulators. Whether protein synthesis is also dysregulated in FXS
patients is not firmly established. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblasts from
FXS patients have significantly elevated rates of basal protein synthesis along
with increased levels of phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-mTOR),
phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphorylated p70 
ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (p-S6K1). The treatment with small molecules that inhibit
S6K1 and a known FMRP target, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit 
p110β, lowered the rates of protein synthesis in both control and patient
fibroblasts. Our data thus demonstrate that fibroblasts from FXS patients may be 
a useful in vitro model to test the efficacy and toxicity of potential
therapeutics prior to clinical trials, as well as for drug screening and
designing personalized treatment approaches.

Autism is a heritable disorder, with over 250 associated genes identified to
date, yet no single gene accounts for >1-2% of cases. The clinical presentation, 
behavioural symptoms, imaging and histopathology findings are strikingly
heterogeneous. A more complete understanding of autism can be obtained by
examining multiple genetic or behavioural mouse models of autism using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)-based neuroanatomical phenotyping. Twenty-six different
mouse models were examined and the consistently found abnormal brain regions
across models were parieto-temporal lobe, cerebellar cortex, frontal lobe,
hypothalamus and striatum. These models separated into three distinct clusters,
two of which can be linked to the under and over-connectivity found in autism.
These clusters also identified previously unknown connections between Nrxn1α, En2
and Fmr1; Nlgn3, BTBR and Slc6A4; and also between X monosomy and Mecp2. With no 
single treatment for autism found, clustering autism using neuroanatomy and
identifying these strong connections may prove to be a crucial step in predicting
treatment response.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability,
developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders. This syndrome is due to a
functional loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP, and, in most cases, it is caused
by CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 promoter. Yet, also other FMR1 mutations may 
cause a FXS-like phenotype. Since standard molecular testing does not include the
analysis of the FMR1 coding region, the prevalence of point mutations causing FXS
is not well known. Here, high resolution melting (HRM) was used to screen for
FMR1 gene mutations in 508 males with clinical signs of mental retardation and
developmental delay, but without CGG and GCC repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene
and AFF2 genes, respectively. Sequence variations were identified by HRM analysis
and verified by direct DNA sequencing. Two novel missense mutations (p.Gly482Ser 
in one patient and p.Arg534His in two unrelated patients), one intronic and two
3'-untranslated region (UTR) variations were identified in the FMR1 gene.
Missense mutations in the FMR1 gene might account for a considerable proportion
of cases in male patients with FXS-related symptoms, such as those linked to
mental retardation and developmental delay.

Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders
characterized by impairments of social interaction, communication and restricted,
repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities.
Frequencies of chromosomal abnormalities in cohorts of individuals with ASD
varying between 1.2 and 28.6% have been reported. In this study, we evaluated 203
Thai children who met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), for autistic disorder or pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and who had neither
major dysmorphic features nor CGG repeat expansions of the FMR1 gene. A routine
G-banding chromosome analysis was performed at a minimum of ISCN 400-550 bands. A
chromosomal abnormality was observed in one child (0.5%), a 41-month-old boy with
a ring chromosome 13 detected by G-banding analysis and subsequently confirmed by
FISH. SNP microarray analysis detected a 2.11-Mb deletion of chromosome 13q34,
encompassing 23 genes. The MCF2L and UPF3A genes are among those genes that may
explain the autistic features in our case. To the best of our knowledge, only one
autistic case with a ring chromosome 13 has been previously reported. In this
article, we also systemically reviewed 21 studies that utilized a conventional
cytogenetic method to detect chromosomal abnormalities in patients with ASD. When
we summed all cases with chromosomal abnormalities, including the case from our
study, the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities detected by conventional
cytogenetics in patients with ASD was 3.2% (118/3,712).

BACKGROUND: The FMR1 premutation is defined as having 55 to 200 CGG repeats in
the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). The
clinical involvement has been well characterized for fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary ovarian
insufficiency (FXPOI). The behavior/psychiatric and other neurological
manifestations remain to be specified as well as the molecular mechanisms that
will explain the phenotypic variability observed in individuals with the FMR1
premutation.
METHODS: Here we describe a small pilot study of copy number variants (CNVs) in
56 participants with a premutation ranging from 55 to 192 repeats. The
participants were divided into four different clinical groups for the analysis:
those with behavioral problems but no autism spectrum disorder (ASD); those with 
ASD but without neurological problems; those with ASD and neurological problems
including seizures; and those with neurological problems without ASD.
RESULTS: We found 12 rare CNVs (eight duplications and four deletions) in 11
cases (19.6%) that were not found in approximately 8,000 controls. Three of them 
were at 10q26 and two at Xp22.3, with small areas of overlap. The CNVs were more 
commonly identified in individuals with neurological involvement and ASD.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies were not statistically significant across the
groups. There were no significant differences in the psychometric and behavior
scores among all groups. Further studies are necessary to determine the frequency
of second genetic hits in individuals with the FMR1 premutation; however, these
preliminary results suggest that genomic studies can be useful in understanding
the molecular etiology of clinical involvement in premutation carriers with ASD
and neurological involvement.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that has a 
major effect on neuronal protein synthesis. Transcriptional silencing of the FMR1
gene leads to loss of FMRP and development of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most 
common known hereditary cause of intellectual impairment and autism. Here we
utilize SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics to analyze murine FMR1(-) and 
FMR1(+) fibroblastic cell lines derived from FMR1-KO embryos to identify proteins
and phosphorylation sites dysregulated as a consequence of FMRP loss. We quantify
FMRP-related changes in the levels of 5,023 proteins and 6,133 phosphorylation
events and map them onto major signal transduction pathways. Our study confirms
global downregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and decrease in phosphorylation
level of ERK1/2 in the absence of FMRP, which is connected to attenuation of
long-term potentiation. We detect differential expression of several key proteins
from the p53 pathway, pointing to the involvement of p53 signaling in
dysregulated cell cycle control in FXS. Finally, we detect differential
expression and phosphorylation of proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing and
nuclear transport, as well as Wnt and calcium signaling, such as PLC, PKC, NFAT, 
and cPLA2. We postulate that calcium homeostasis is likely affected in molecular 
pathogenesis of FXS.

BACKGROUND: Intellectual disability (ID) is characterised by an extreme genetic
heterogeneity. Several hundred genes have been associated to monogenic forms of
ID, considerably complicating molecular diagnostics. Trio-exome sequencing was
recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, yet remains costly for a general
implementation.
METHODS: We report the alternative strategy of targeted high-throughput
sequencing of 217 genes in which mutations had been reported in patients with ID 
or autism as the major clinical concern. We analysed 106 patients with ID of
unknown aetiology following array-CGH analysis and other genetic investigations. 
Ninety per cent of these patients were males, and 75% sporadic cases.
RESULTS: We identified 26 causative mutations: 16 in X-linked genes (ATRX, CUL4B,
DMD, FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1, IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA, MECP2, SLC9A6, SLC16A2, PHF8)
and 10 de novo in autosomal-dominant genes (DYRK1A, GRIN1, MED13L, TCF4, RAI1,
SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1). We also detected four possibly causative mutations (eg,
in NLGN3) requiring further investigations. We present detailed reasoning for
assigning causality for each mutation, and associated patients' clinical
information. Some genes were hit more than once in our cohort, suggesting they
correspond to more frequent ID-associated conditions (KDM5C, MECP2, DYRK1A,
TCF4). We highlight some unexpected genotype to phenotype correlations, with
causative mutations being identified in genes associated to defined syndromes in 
patients deviating from the classic phenotype (DMD, TCF4, MECP2). We also bring
additional supportive (HCFC1, MED13L) or unsupportive (SHROOM4, SRPX2) evidences 
for the implication of previous candidate genes or mutations in cognitive
disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: With a diagnostic yield of 25% targeted sequencing appears relevant 
as a first intention test for the diagnosis of ID, but importantly will also
contribute to a better understanding regarding the specific contribution of the
many genes implicated in ID and autism.

Visual sensory impairments are common in Mental Deficiency (MD) and Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These defects are linked to cerebral dysfunction in the 
visual cortical area characterized by the deregulation of axon growth/guidance
and dendrite spine immaturity of neurons. However, visual perception had not been
addressed, although the retina is part of the central nervous system with a
common embryonic origin. Therefore, we investigated retinal perception, the first
event of vision, in a murine model of MD with autistic features. We document that
retinal function is altered in Fmr1 KO mice, a model of human Fragile X Syndrome.
Indeed, In Fmr1 KO mice had a lower retinal function characterized by a decreased
photoreceptors neuron response, due to a 40% decrease in Rhodopsin content and to
Rod Outer Segment destabilization. In addition, we observed an alteration of the 
visual signal transmission between photoreceptors and the inner retina which
could be attributed to deregulations of pre- and post- synaptic proteins
resulting in retinal neurons synaptic destabilization and to retinal neurons
immaturity. Thus, for the first time, we demonstrated that retinal perception is 
altered in a murine model of MD with autistic features and that there are strong 
similarities between cerebral and retinal cellular and molecular defects. Our
results suggest that both visual perception and integration must be taken into
account in assessing visual sensory impairments in MD and ASD.

The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset
neurodegenerative disorder affecting a subset of carriers of the FMR1 (fragile X 
mental retardation 1) premutation. Penetrance and expression appear to be
significantly higher in males than females. Although the most obvious aspect of
the phenotype is the movement disorder that gives FXTAS its name, the disorder is
also accompanied by progressive cognitive impairment. In this review, we address 
the cognitive neuropsychological and neurophysiological phenotype for males and
females with FXTAS, and for male and female unaffected carriers. Despite
differences in penetrance and expression, the cognitive features of the disorder 
appear similar for both genders, with impairment of executive functioning,
working memory, and information processing the most prominent. Deficits in these 
functional systems may be largely responsible for impairment on other measures,
including tests of general intelligence and declarative learning. FXTAS is to a
large extent a white matter disease, and the cognitive phenotypes observed are
consistent with what some have described as white matter dementia, in contrast to
the impaired cortical functioning more characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and 
related disorders. Although some degree of impaired executive functioning appears
to be ubiquitous among persons with FXTAS, the data suggest that only a subset of
unaffected carriers of the premutation - both female and male - demonstrate such 
deficits, which typically are mild. The best-studied phenotype is that of males
with FXTAS. The manifestations of cognitive impairment among asymptomatic male
carriers, and among women with and without FXTAS, are less well understood, but
have come under increased scrutiny.

In 1994, it was suggested that AGG interruptions affect the stability of the
fragile X triplet repeat. Until recently, however, this hypothesis was not
explored on a large scale due primarily to the technical difficulty of
determining AGG interruption patterns of the two alleles in females. The recent
development of a PCR technology that overcomes this difficulty and accurately
identifies the number and position of AGGs has led to several studies that
examine their influence on repeat stability. Here, we present a historical
perspective of relevant studies published during the last 20 years on AGG
interruptions and examine those recent publications that have refined risk
estimates for repeat instability and full-mutation expansions.

BACKGROUND: The presence of AGG interruptions in the CGG repeat locus of the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene decreases the instability of the
allele during transmission from parent to child, and decreases the risk of
expansion of a premutation allele to a full mutation allele (the predominant
cause of fragile X syndrome) during maternal transmission.
METHODS: To strengthen recent findings on the utility of AGG interruptions in
predicting instability or expansion to a full mutation of FMR1 CGG repeat
alleles, we assessed the outcomes of 108 intermediate (also named gray zone) and 
710 premutation alleles that were transmitted from parent to child, and collected
from four international clinical sites. We have used the results to revise our
initial model that predicted the risk of a maternal premutation allele expanding 
to a full mutation during transmission and to test the effect of AGG
interruptions on the magnitude of expanded allele instability of intermediate or 
premutation alleles that did not expand to a full mutation.
RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, the number of AGG triplets that
interrupts the CGG repeat locus was found to influence the risk of allele
instability, including expansion to a full mutation. The total length of the CGG 
repeat allele remains the best predictor of instability or expansion to a full
mutation, but the number of AGG interruptions and, to a much lesser degree,
maternal age are also factors when considering the risk of transmission of the
premutation allele to a full mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that a model with total CGG length, number 
of AGG interruptions, and maternal age is recommended for calculating the risk of
expansion to a full mutation during maternal transmission. Taken together, the
results of this study provide relevant information for the genetic counseling of 
female premutation carriers, and improve the current predictive models which
calculate risk of expansion to a full mutation using only total CGG repeat
length.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are known to critically influence
brain development and functions. Dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs has been 
suggested as a non-pharmacological therapy for a number of developmental
disorders, e.g., autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), but human studies so far have
led to conflicting results. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that the
therapeutic impact of n-3 PUFAs on these disorders might be explained by their
anti-inflammatory properties and their promoting effects on synaptic function and
plasticity, but no clear evidence has been produced in this direction. We
evaluated the impact of n-3 PUFA dietary supplementation in a mouse model of
fragile X syndrome (FXS), i.e., a major developmental disease and the most
frequent monogenic cause of ASD. Fmr1-KO and wild-type mice were provided with a 
diet enriched or not with n-3 PUFAs from weaning until adulthood when they were
tested for multiple FXS-like behaviors. The brain expression of several cytokines
and of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was concomitantly assessed as
inflammatory and synaptic markers. n-3 PUFA supplementation rescued most of the
behavioral abnormalities displayed by Fmr1-KO mice, including alterations in
emotionality, social interaction and non-spatial memory, although not their
deficits in social recognition and spatial memory. n-3 PUFAs also rescued most of
the neuroinflammatory imbalances of KOs, but had a limited impact on their BDNF
deficits. These results demonstrate that n-3 PUFAs dietary supplementation,
although not a panacea, has a considerable therapeutic value for FXS and
potentially for ASD, suggesting a major mediating role of neuroinflammatory
mechanisms.

Rescue of fragile X syndrome phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice by a BKCa channel opener 
molecule.

O, Briault S.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited
intellectual disability and is also associated with autism spectrum disorders.
Previous studies implicated BKCa channels in the neuropathogenesis of FXS, but
the main question was whether pharmacological BKCa stimulation would be able to
rescue FXS neurobehavioral phenotypes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a selective BKCa channel opener molecule
(BMS-204352) to address this issue in Fmr1 KO mice, modeling the FXS
pathophysiology. In vitro, acute BMS-204352 treatment (10 μM) restored the
abnormal dendritic spine phenotype. In vivo, a single injection of BMS-204352
(2 mg/kg) rescued the hippocampal glutamate homeostasis and the behavioral
phenotype. Indeed, disturbances in social recognition and interaction, non-social
anxiety, and spatial memory were corrected by BMS-204352 in Fmr1 KO mice.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the BKCa channel is a new therapeutic

impairments (social, emotional and cognitive) in an animal model of FXS. This
pharmacological molecule might open new ways for FXS therapy.

The FMR1 gene is subject to repeat mediated-gene silencing when the CGG-repeat
tract in the 5' UTR exceeds 200 repeat units. This results in Fragile X syndrome,
the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and a major cause of
autism spectrum disorders. The mechanism of gene silencing is not fully
understood, and efforts to reverse this gene silencing have had limited success. 
Here, we show that the level of trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27, a
hallmark of the activity of EZH2, a component of repressive Polycomb Group (PcG) 
complexes like PRC2, is increased on reactivation of the silenced allele by
either the DNA demethylating agent 5-azadeoxycytidine or the SIRT1 inhibitor
splitomicin. The level of H3K27me3 increases and decreases in parallel with the
FMR1 mRNA level. Furthermore, reducing the levels of the FMR1 mRNA reduces the
accumulation of H3K27me3. This suggests a model for FMR1 gene silencing in which 
the FMR1 mRNA generated from the reactivated allele acts in cis to repress its
own transcription via the recruitment of PcG complexes to the FMR1 locus.

An increasing number of studies implicate the GABAAergic system in the
pathophysiology of the fragile X syndrome, a frequent cause of intellectual
disability and autism. Animal models have proven invaluable in unravelling the
molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder. Multiple defects in this inhibitory
system have been identified in Fmr1 knockout mice, including altered expression
of various components, aberrant GABAA receptor-mediated signalling, altered GABA 
concentrations and anatomical defects in GABAergic neurons. Aberrations
compatible with those described in the mouse model were detected in dfmr1
deficient Drosophila melanogaster, a validated fly model for the fragile X
syndrome. Treatment with drugs that ameliorate the GABAAergic deficiency in both 
animal models have demonstrated that the GABAA receptor is a promising target for
the treatment of fragile X patients. Based on these preclinical studies, clinical
trials in patients have been initiated.

Fragile X-associated disorders (FXD) are a group of disorders caused by expansion
of non-coding CGG repeat elements in the fragile X (FMR1) gene. One of these
disorders, fragile X syndrome (FXS), is the most common heritable cause of
intellectual disability, and is caused by large CGG repeat expansions (>200)
resulting in silencing of the FMR1 gene. An increasingly recognized number of
neuropsychiatric FXD have recently been identified that are caused by
'premutation' range expansions (55-200). These disorders are characterized by a
spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations ranging from an increased risk of
neurodevelopmental, mood and anxiety disorders to neurodegenerative phenotypes
such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Here, we review 
advances in the clinical understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders in
premutation carriers across the lifespan and offer guidance for the detection of 
such disorders by practicing psychiatrists and neurologists.

CGG repeat expansion is the most common cause of fragile X syndrome. Numerous
efforts have been made to identify novel mutations in patients with intellectual 
disability, developmental delay, and/or autism. To evaluate the mutational
spectrum in the at-risk Chinese population, 60 pediatric patients presenting
fragile X traits but normal-sized CGG repeats were sequenced for all 17 exons and
regulatory regions in FMR1. A c.879A>C mutation, reported to alter a neighboring 
splicing, was detected in a severely retarded male and his normal mother.
However, the exon junction appears unaffected. A 237-kb deletion covering the
entire FMR1 was identified to cause moderate intellectual disability and marked
hyperactivity in an 8-year-old boy. The 5' and 3' breakpoints were buried in the 
surrounding long interspersed and short interspersed elements, respectively. In
general, missense mutations do not commonly cause fragile X syndrome, whereas
deletions should be considered with caution in patient referrals presenting with 
developmental delay and/or ordinary retardation.

Reciprocal copy-number variation (CNV) of a 593 kb region of 16p11.2 is a common 
genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet it is not completely
penetrant and can manifest in a wide array of phenotypes. To explore its
molecular consequences, we performed RNA sequencing of cerebral cortex from mouse
models with CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region and lymphoblast lines from 34 members
of 7 multiplex ASD-affected families harboring the 16p11.2 CNV. Expression of all
genes in the CNV region correlated well with their DNA copy number, with no
evidence of dosage compensation. We observed effects on gene expression outside
the CNV region, including apparent positional effects in cis and in trans at
genomic segments with evidence of physical interaction in Hi-C chromosome
conformation data. One of the most significant positional effects was telomeric
to the 16p11.2 CNV and includes the previously described "distal" 16p11.2
microdeletion. Overall, 16p11.2 CNV was associated with altered expression of
genes and networks that converge on multiple hypotheses of ASD pathogenesis,
including synaptic function (e.g., NRXN1, NRXN3), chromatin modification (e.g.,
CHD8, EHMT1, MECP2), transcriptional regulation (e.g., TCF4, SATB2), and
intellectual disability (e.g., FMR1, CEP290). However, there were differences
between tissues and species, with the strongest effects being consistently within
the CNV region itself. Our analyses suggest that through a combination of
indirect regulatory effects and direct effects on nuclear architecture,
alteration of 16p11.2 genes disrupts expression networks that involve other genes
and pathways known to contribute to ASD, suggesting an overlap in mechanisms of
pathogenesis.

Fluoxetine is used as a therapeutic agent for autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
including Fragile X syndrome (FXS). The treatment often associates with
disruptive behaviors such as agitation and disinhibited behaviors in FXS. To
identify mechanisms that increase the risk to poor treatment outcome, we
investigated the behavioral and cellular effects of fluoxetine on adult Fmr1
knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model for FXS. We found that fluoxetine reduced
anxiety-like behavior of both wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice seen as shortened
latency to enter the center area in the open field test. In Fmr1 KO mice,
fluoxetine normalized locomotor hyperactivity but abnormally increased
exploratory activity. Reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
increased TrkB receptor expression levels in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice
associated with inappropriate coping responses under stressful condition and
abolished antidepressant activity of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine response in the cell 
proliferation was also missing in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice when compared
with wild-type controls. The postnatal mRNA expression of serotonin transporter
(SERT) was reduced in the thalamic nuclei of Fmr1 KO mice during the time of
transient innervation of somatosensory neurons suggesting that developmental
changes of SERT expression were involved in the differential cellular and
behavioral responses to fluoxetine in wild-type and Fmr1 mice. The results
indicate that changes of BDNF/TrkB signaling contribute to differential
behavioral responses to fluoxetine among individuals with ASD.

Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability and a well-known
cause of autism spectrum disorder, is the result of loss or dysfunction of
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a highly selective RNA-binding
protein and translation regulator. A major research priority has been the
identification of the mRNA targets of FMRP, particularly as recent studies
suggest an excess of FMRP targets among genes implicated in idiopathic autism and
schizophrenia. Several large-scale studies have attempted to identify mRNAs bound
by FMRP through several methods, each generating a list of putative target genes,
leading to distinct hypotheses by which FMRP recognizes its targets; namely, by
RNA structure or sequence. However, no in depth analyses have been performed to
identify the level of consensus among the studies. Here, we analyze four large
FMRP target datasets to generate high-confidence consensus lists, and examine all
datasets for sequence elements within the target RNAs to validate reported FMRP
binding motifs (GACR, ACUK and WGGA). We found GACR to be highly enriched in FMRP
datasets, while ACUK was not. The WGGA pattern was modestly enriched in several, 
but not all datasets. The previous association between FMRP and G-quadruplexes
prompted the analysis of the distribution of WGGA in the target genes. Consistent
with the requirements for G-quadruplex formation, we observed highly clustered
WGGA motifs in FMRP targets compared with other genes, implicating both RNA
structure and sequence in the recognition motif of FMRP. In addition, we generate
a list of the top 40 FMRP targets associated with FXS-related phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic form of
intellectual disability and one of the few known monogenic causes of autism. It
is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 ('Fragile X Mental
Retardation 1') gene, which prevents expression of the 'Fragile X Mental
Retardation Protein' (FMRP). In FXS, the absence of FMRP leads to altered
structural and functional development of the synapse, while preventing
activity-based synapse maturation and synaptic pruning, which are essential for
normal brain development and cognitive development. Possible impairments in
information processing can be non-invasively investigated using
electrophysiology.
METHODS: We compared auditory (AEP) and visual (VEP) evoked potentials in twelve 
adolescents and young adults (10-22 years) affected by FXS to healthy controls
matched by chronological age (N=12) and developmental age of cognitive
functioning (N=9; 5-7 years), using analysis of variance.
RESULTS: In the visual modality, the N70 and N2 amplitude have been found
increased in FXS in comparison to the chronological, but not the developmental
control group at occipital sites, whereas in the auditory modality N1, P2 and N2 
amplitude as well as N2 latency have been found increased in FXS, relative to
both chronological and developmental control groups at mid-central sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The AEP/VEP profile suggests disruptions in sensory processing
specific to FXS that exceed immaturity of physiological activity. In addition,
the auditory modality seems to be more affected than the visual modality. Results
are discussed in light of possible underlying neuronal mechanisms, including
deficits in synaptic pruning and neuronal inhibition that might account for a
hyperreactive nervous system in FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of inherited intellectual
disability. Comorbidities of FXS such as autism are increasingly linked to
imbalances in excitation and inhibition (E/I) as well as dysfunction in GABAergic
transmission in a number of brain regions including the amygdala. However, the
link between E/I imbalance and GABAergic transmission deficits in the FXS
amygdala is poorly understood. Here we reveal that normal tonic GABAA
receptor-mediated neurotransmission in principal neurons (PNs) of the basolateral
amygdala (BLA) is comprised of both δ- and α5-subunit-containing GABAA receptors.
Furthermore, tonic GABAergic capacity is reduced in these neurons in the Fmr1
knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS (1.5-fold total, 3-fold δ-subunit, and 2-fold
α5-subunit mediated) as indicated by application of gabazine (50 μM),
4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP, 1 μM), and α5ia (1.5 μM) in
whole cell patch-clamp recordings. Moreover, α5-containing tonic GABAA receptors 
appear to preferentially modulate nonsomatic compartments of BLA PNs. Examination
of evoked feedforward synaptic transmission in these cells surprisingly revealed 
no differences in overall synaptic conductance or E/I balance between wild-type
(WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. Instead, we observed altered feedforward kinetics in Fmr1 
KO PNs that supports a subtle yet significant decrease in E/I balance at the peak
of excitatory conductance. Blockade of α5-subunit-containing GABAA receptors
replicated this condition in WT PNs. Therefore, our data suggest that tonic GABAA
receptor-mediated neurotransmission can modulate synaptic E/I balance and timing 
established by feedforward inhibition and thus may represent a therapeutic target
to enhance amygdala function in FXS.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common monogenetic form of intellectual disability
and is a leading cause of autism. This syndrome is produced by the reduced
transcription of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, and it is
characterized by a range of symptoms heterogeneously expressed in patients such
as cognitive impairment, seizure susceptibility, altered pain sensitivity and
anxiety. The recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiological
mechanisms involved have opened novel potential therapeutic approaches identified
in preclinical rodent models as a necessary preliminary step for the subsequent
evaluation in patients. Among those possible therapeutic approaches, the
modulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling or the GABA receptor 
signaling have focused most of the attention. New findings in the animal models
open other possible therapeutic approaches such as the mammalian target of
rapamycin signaling pathway or the endocannabinoid system. This review summarizes
the emerging data recently obtained in preclinical models of fragile X syndrome
supporting these new therapeutic perspectives.

High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) enables the
detection of intragenic rearrangements, such as single exon deletion or
duplication. This approach can lead to the identification of new disease genes.
We report on the analysis of 54 male patients presenting with intellectual
deficiency (ID) and a family history suggesting X-linked (XL) inheritance or
maternal skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), using a home-made
X-chromosome-specific microarray covering the whole human X-chromosome at high
resolution. The majority of patients had whole genome array-CGH prior to the
selection and we did not include large rearrangements such as MECP2 and FMR1
duplications. We identified four rearrangements considered as causative or
potentially pathogenic, corresponding to a detection rate of 8%. Two CNVs
affected known XLID genes and were therefore considered as causative (IL1RAPL1
and OPHN1 intragenic deletions). Two new CNVs were considered as potentially
pathogenic as they affected interesting candidates for ID. The first CNV is a
deletion of the first exon of the TRPC5 gene, encoding a cation channel
implicated in dendrite growth and patterning, in a child presenting with ID and
an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The second CNV is a partial deletion of
KLHL15, in a patient with severe ID, epilepsy, and anomalies of cortical
development. In both cases, in spite of strong arguments for clinical relevance, 
we were not able at this stage to confirm pathogenicity of the mutations, and the
causality of the variants identified in XLID remains to be confirmed.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited disorder that results in intellectual
disability and a characteristic behavioral profile that includes autism spectrum 
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory hypersensitivity,
hyperarousal, and anxiety. The epigenetic silencing of FMR1 and the consequent
absence of its protein product, FMRP, is the most common cause of fragile X. The 
development of animal models of fragile X syndrome 20 years ago has produced a
considerable increase in our understanding of the consequences of the absence of 
FMRP on the structure and function of the nervous system. Some of the insights
gained have led to proposals of treatment strategies that are based on cellular
and molecular changes observed in animals lacking FMRP. One such proposal is
treatment with lithium, a drug with a long history of clinical efficacy in
psychiatry and a drug with newly described uses in degenerative disorders of the 
nervous system. Lithium treatment has been studied extensively in both mouse and 
fruit fly models of FXS, and it has been shown to reverse numerous behavioral,
physiological, cellular, and molecular phenotypes. A report of a pilot clinical
trial on a limited number of adult FXS patients indicated that measurable
improvements in behavior and function were seen after 2 months of lithium
treatment. A double-blind clinical trial of lithium treatment in FXS patients is 
now needed.

Animal models are critical for gaining insights into autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Despite their apparent advantages to mice for neural studies, rats have
not been widely used for disorders of the human CNS, such as ASD, for the lack of
convenient genome manipulation tools. Here we describe two of the first
transgenic rat models for ASD, developed using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)
methodologies, and their initial behavioral assessment using a rapid juvenile
test battery. A syndromic and nonsyndromic rat model for ASD were created as two 
separate knockout rat lines with heritable disruptions in the genes encoding
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Neuroligin3 (NLGN3). FMRP, a
protein with numerous proposed functions including regulation of mRNA and
synaptic protein synthesis, and NLGN3, a member of the neuroligin synaptic
cell-adhesion protein family, have been implicated in human ASD. Juvenile
subjects from both knockout rat lines exhibited abnormalities in ASD-relevant
phenotypes including juvenile play, perseverative behaviors, and sensorimotor
gating. These data provide important first evidence regarding the utility of rats
as genetic models for investigating ASD-relevant genes.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), due to mutations of the FMR1 gene, is the most common
known inherited cause of developmental disability as well as the most common
single-gene risk factor for autism. Our goal was to examine variation in brain
structure in FXS with topological data analysis (TDA), and to assess how such
variation is associated with measures of IQ and autism-related behaviors. To this
end, we analyzed imaging and behavioral data from young boys (n = 52; aged
1.57-4.15 years) diagnosed with FXS. Application of topological methods to
structural MRI data revealed two large subgroups within the study population.
Comparison of these subgroups showed significant between-subgroup neuroanatomical
differences similar to those previously reported to distinguish children with FXS
from typically developing controls (e.g., enlarged caudate). In addition to
neuroanatomy, the groups showed significant differences in IQ and autism severity
scores. These results suggest that despite arising from a single gene mutation,
FXS may encompass two biologically, and clinically separable phenotypes. In
addition, these findings underscore the potential of TDA as a powerful tool in
the search for biological phenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have in common 
alterations in some brain circuits and brain abnormalities, such as synaptic
transmission and dendritic spines morphology. Recent studies have indicated a
differential expression for specific categories of genes as a cause for both
types of disease, while an increasing number of genes is recognized to produce
both disorders. An example is the Fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1),
whose silencing causes the Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of ID and
autism, also characterized by physical hallmarks. Fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP), the protein encoded by FMR1, is an RNA-binding protein with an
important role in translational control. Among the interactors of FMRP, CYFIP1/2 
(cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein) proteins are good candidates for ID and
autism, on the bases of their genetic implication and functional properties, even
if the precise functional significance of the CYFIP/FMRP interaction is not
understood yet. CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 represent a link between Rac1, the WAVE (WAS
protein family member) complex and FMRP, favoring the cross talk between actin
polymerization and translational control.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common causes of intellectual
disability/developmental delay (ID/DD), especially in males. It is caused most
often by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions, and less frequently by point
mutations and partial or full deletions of the FMR1 gene. The wide clinical
spectrum of affected females partly depends on their X-inactivation status. Only 
few female ID/DD patients with microdeletions including FMR1 have been reported. 
We describe 3 female patients with 3.5-, 4.2- and 9.2-Mb de novo microdeletions
in Xq27.3-q28 containing FMR1. X-inactivation was random in all patients, yet
they presented with ID/DD as well as speech delay, macrocephaly and other
features attributable to FXS. No signs of autism were present. Here, we further
delineate the clinical spectrum of female patients with microdeletions. FMR1
expression studies gave no evidence for an absolute threshold below which signs
of FXS present. Since FMR1 expression is known to be highly variable between
unrelated females, and since FMR1 mRNA levels have been suggested to be more
similar among family members, we further explored the possibility of an
intrafamilial effect. Interestingly, FMR1 mRNA levels in all 3 patients were
significantly lower than in their respective mothers, which was shown to be
specific for patients with microdeletions containing FMR1.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability
and the leading genetic cause of autism. Impaired phonological processing in
fragile X syndrome interferes with the development of language skills. Although
auditory cortex responses are known to be abnormal in fragile X syndrome, it is
not clear how these differences impact speech sound processing. This study
provides the first evidence that the cortical representation of speech sounds is 
impaired in Fmr1 knockout rats, despite normal speech discrimination behavior.
Evoked potentials and spiking activity in response to speech sounds, noise burst 
trains, and tones were significantly degraded in primary auditory cortex,
anterior auditory field and the ventral auditory field. Neurometric analysis of
speech evoked activity using a pattern classifier confirmed that activity in
these fields contains significantly less information about speech sound identity 
in Fmr1 knockout rats compared to control rats. Responses were normal in the
posterior auditory field, which is associated with sound localization. The
greatest impairment was observed in the ventral auditory field, which is related 
to emotional regulation. Dysfunction in the ventral auditory field may contribute
to poor emotional regulation in fragile X syndrome and may help explain the
observation that later auditory evoked responses are more disturbed in fragile X 
syndrome compared to earlier responses. Rodent models of fragile X syndrome are
likely to prove useful for understanding the biological basis of fragile X
syndrome and for testing candidate therapies.

2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP) reverses maze learning and PSD-95
deficits in Fmr1 knock-out mice.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by the lack of expression of the fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP), which results in intellectual disability and
other debilitating symptoms including impairment of visual-spatial functioning.
FXS is the only single-gene disorder that is highly co-morbid with autism
spectrum disorder and can therefore provide insight into its pathophysiology.
Lack of FMRP results in altered group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)
signaling, which is a target for putative treatments. The Hebb-Williams (H-W)
mazes are a set of increasingly complex spatial navigation problems that depend
on intact hippocampal and thus mGluR-5 functioning. In the present investigation,
we examined whether an antagonist of mGluR-5 would reverse previously described
behavioral deficits in fragile X mental retardation 1 knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice.
Mice were trained on a subset of the H-W mazes and then treated with either 20
mg/kg of an mGluR-5 antagonist, 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP; n =
11) or an equivalent dose of saline (n = 11) prior to running test mazes. Latency
and errors were dependent variables recorded during the test phase. Immediately
after completing each test, marble-burying behavior was assessed, which confirmed
that the drug treatment was pharmacologically active during maze learning.
Although latency was not statistically different between the groups, MPEP treated
Fmr1 KO mice made significantly fewer errors on mazes deemed more difficult
suggesting a reversal of the behavioral deficit. MPEP treated mice were also less
perseverative and impulsive when navigating mazes. Furthermore, MPEP treatment
reversed post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) protein deficits in Fmr1 KO treated
mice, whereas levels of a control protein (β-tubulin) remained unchanged. These
data further validate MPEP as a potentially beneficial treatment for FXS. Our
findings also suggest that adapted H-W mazes may be a useful tool to document
alterations in behavioral functioning following pharmacological intervention in
FXS.

Fragile X (FX) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and
autism. Previous studies have shown that partial inhibition of metabotropic
glutamate receptor signaling is sufficient to correct behavioral phenotypes in a 
mouse model of FX, including audiogenic seizures, open-field hyperactivity and
social behavior. These phenotypes model well the epilepsy (15%), hyperactivity
(20%) and autism (30%) that are comorbid with FX in human patients. Identifying
reliable and robust mouse phenotypes to model cognitive impairments is critical
considering the 90% comorbidity of FX and intellectual disability. Recent work
characterized a five-choice visuospatial discrimination assay testing cognitive
flexibility, in which FX model mice show impairments associated with decreases in
synaptic proteins in prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, we sought to
determine whether instrumental extinction, another process requiring PFC, is
altered in FX model mice, and whether downregulation of metabotropic glutamate
receptor signaling pathways is sufficient to correct both visuospatial
discrimination and extinction phenotypes. We report that instrumental extinction 
is consistently exaggerated in FX model mice. However, neither the extinction
phenotype nor the visuospatial discrimination phenotype is corrected by
approaches targeting metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling. This work
describes a novel behavioral extinction assay to model impaired cognition in
mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, provides evidence that extinction
is exaggerated in the FX mouse model and suggests possible limitations of
metabotropic glutamate receptor-based pharmacotherapy.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and is caused by a loss of function of the fragile X mental
retardation (fmr1) gene. Animal fmr1-knockout (KO) models are not only of
interest for the study of FXS, but have also important implications for our
understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we report the behavioral
changes in fmr1-knockout zebrafish in an open field with two white and two
transparent walls. The neophobic responses that in wild-type (WT) zebrafish
normally occur during the first 5-10 min in an unfamiliar environment (such as
freezing, hypo-activity and preferences for the bottom and opaque walls of the
tank), were weakened in fmr1 mutants, suggesting a reduction of novelty-induced
anxiety. The fmr1-KO zebrafish showed somewhat increased vertical activity beyond
the 'neophobic phase', but no overall hyperactivity. The mutants demonstrated a
clear habituation-independent preference for the transparent walls. Whether this 
was attributable to altered spatial information processing or to reduced
avoidance of open spaces is discussed. Finally, since restrictive repetitive (or 
stereotypical) behaviors are frequently present in FXS and ASD patients, we
analyzed relative turning angles, directional and preferential turning ratios and
performed frequency-domain analysis. However, no indications of abnormal movement
patterning were detected. The possible reasons for the absence of stereotypical
behaviors are discussed in terms of behavioral endpoint selection and of
eliciting conditions. Overall, our findings are consistent with those reported in
fmr1-KO mice and suggest that further analysis of the fmr1-KO zebrafish model has
potential to deepen our understanding of FXS and ASD.

neurobehavioral profiles from a parent survey.

Although it is suspected that anxiety modifies the clinical presentation of
autism in fragile X syndrome (FXS), neuropsychiatric co-morbidity profiles of
these two disorders have not been extensively studied. The National Fragile X
Survey was completed for 1,027 males with FXS, for whom yes/no information
regarding the presence of several disorders is provided. Although the survey
exhibited limited depth and lacked validation by standardized measures, this
exploratory study was conducted to take advantage of the data as an opportunity
for identifying future lines of inquiry. We addressed the following questions:
(i) how do the co-morbidity profiles of FXS males with both autism and anxiety
compare to those without anxiety?; (ii) do individuals with autism exhibit
specific co-morbidity profiles compared to FXS males with anxiety only, or
without either autism or anxiety?; (iii) how do co-morbidity profiles in children
ages 3-11 differ from profiles of individuals >12 years? The group with autism
and anxiety reported the highest prevalence of attention problems,
hyperactivity/impulsivity, self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness. In
addition, the lowest prevalence rates of these conditions were often observed in 
non-anxious groups regardless of autism status. Overall, this exploratory
analysis generated several hypotheses for further study: (i) anxiety increases
the severity of autism in FXS, particularly through additional behavioral
abnormalities; (ii) some neuropsychiatric and behavioral conditions (i.e.,
attention problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity, aggressiveness) are primarily
related to comorbid anxiety, not autism; (iii) prevalence of behavioral
abnormalities increases with age. Future studies evaluating these hypotheses
should incorporate validated neurobehavioral assessments, and control for
cognitive level.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and is closely linked with autism. The genetic basis of FXS is an
expansion of CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene on the X 
chromosome leading to the loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation 
protein (FMRP). The cause of FXS has been known for over 20 years, yet the full
molecular and cellular consequences of this mutation remain unclear. Although
mouse and fly models have provided significant understanding of this disorder and
its effects on the central nervous system, insight from human studies is limited.
We have created human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from fibroblasts
obtained from individuals with FXS to enable in vitro modeling of the human
disease. Three young boys with FXS who came from a well-characterized cohort
representative of the range of affectedness typical for the syndrome were
recruited to aid in linking cellular and behavioral phenotypes. The FMR1 mutation
is preserved during the reprogramming of patient fibroblasts to iPSCs. Mosaicism 
of the CGG repeat length in one of the patient's fibroblasts allowed for the
generation of isogenic lines with differing CGG repeat lengths from the same
patient. FXS forebrain neurons were differentiated from these iPSCs and display
defective neurite initiation and extension. These cells provide a
well-characterized resource to examine potential neuronal deficits caused by FXS 
as well as the function of FMRP in human neurons.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic form of autism spectrum
disorder, is caused by deficiency of the fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP). Despite extensive research and scientific progress, understanding how
FMRP regulates brain development and function remains a major challenge. FMRP is 
a neuronal RNA-binding protein that binds about a third of messenger RNAs in the 
brain and controls their translation, stability, and cellular localization. The
absence of FMRP results in increased protein synthesis, leading to enhanced
signaling in a number of intracellular pathways, including the mTOR, mGLuR5, ERK,
Gsk3β, PI3K, and insulin pathways. Until recently, FXS was largely considered a
deficit of mature neurons; however, a number of new studies have shown that FMRP 
may also play important roles in stem cells, among them neural stem cells,
germline stem cells, and pluripotent stem cells. In this review, we will cover
these newly discovered functions of FMRP, as well as the other two fragile
X-related proteins, in stem cells. We will also discuss the literature on the use
of stem cells, particularly neural stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells,
as model systems for studying the functions of FMRP in neuronal development.

Transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene encoding fragile X mental retardation 
protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited
intellectual disability and the leading genetic cause of autism. FMRP has been
suggested to play important roles in regulating neurotransmission and short-term 
synaptic plasticity at excitatory hippocampal and cortical synapses. However, the
origins and mechanisms of these FMRP actions remain incompletely understood, and 
the role of FMRP in regulating synaptic release probability and presynaptic
function remains debated. Here we used variance-mean analysis and peak-scaled
nonstationary variance analysis to examine changes in both presynaptic and
postsynaptic parameters during repetitive activity at excitatory CA3-CA1
hippocampal synapses in a mouse model of FXS. Our analyses revealed that loss of 
FMRP did not affect the basal release probability or basal synaptic transmission,
but caused an abnormally elevated release probability specifically during
repetitive activity. These abnormalities were not accompanied by changes in
excitatory postsynaptic current kinetics, quantal size or postsynaptic
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor conductance. Our
results thus indicate that FMRP regulates neurotransmission at excitatory
hippocampal synapses specifically during repetitive activity via modulation of
release probability in a presynaptic manner. Our study suggests that FMRP
function in regulating neurotransmitter release is an activity-dependent
phenomenon that may contribute to the pathophysiology of FXS.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis are genetic syndromes that 
both have a high rate of comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Several
lines of evidence suggest that these two monogenic disorders may converge at a
molecular level through the dysfunction of activity-dependent synaptic
plasticity.
METHODS: To explore the characteristics of transcriptomic changes in these
monogenic disorders, we profiled genome-wide gene expression levels in cerebellum
and blood from murine models of fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis.
RESULTS: Differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways were distinct for
the two murine models examined, with the exception of immune response-related
pathways. In the cerebellum of the Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) model, the neuroactive
ligand receptor interaction pathway and gene sets associated with synaptic
plasticity such as long-term potentiation, gap junction, and axon guidance were
the most significantly perturbed pathways. The phosphatidylinositol signaling
pathway was significantly dysregulated in both cerebellum and blood of Fmr1-KO
mice. In Tsc2 heterozygous (+/-) mice, immune system-related pathways, genes
encoding ribosomal proteins, and glycolipid metabolism pathways were
significantly changed in both tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that distinct molecular pathways may be involved in
ASD with known but different genetic causes and that blood gene expression
profiles of Fmr1-KO and Tsc2+/- mice mirror some, but not all, of the perturbed
molecular pathways in the brain.

Auditory processing in fragile x syndrome.

Rotschafer SE(1), Razak KA(1).

Author information:

California, Riverside, CA USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of intellectual disability and
autism. Among other symptoms, FXS patients demonstrate abnormalities in sensory
processing and communication. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological
studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity in humans with FXS.
Consistent with observations in humans, the Fmr1 KO mouse model of FXS also shows
evidence of altered auditory processing and communication deficiencies. A
well-known and commonly used phenotype in pre-clinical studies of FXS is
audiogenic seizures. In addition, increased acoustic startle response is seen in 
the Fmr1 KO mice. In vivo electrophysiological recordings indicate
hyper-excitable responses, broader frequency tuning, and abnormal spectrotemporal
processing in primary auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, auditory
hyper-excitability is a robust, reliable, and translatable biomarker in Fmr1 KO
mice. Abnormal auditory evoked responses have been used as outcome measures to
test therapeutics in FXS patients. Given that similarly abnormal responses are
present in Fmr1 KO mice suggests that cellular mechanisms can be addressed.
Sensory cortical deficits are relatively more tractable from a mechanistic
perspective than more complex social behaviors that are typically studied in
autism and FXS. The focus of this review is to bring together clinical,
functional, and structural studies in humans with electrophysiological and
behavioral studies in mice to make the case that auditory hypersensitivity
provides a unique opportunity to integrate molecular, cellular, circuit level
studies with behavioral outcomes in the search for therapeutics for FXS and other
autism spectrum disorders.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common identifiable genetic
cause of intellectual disability and autistic spectrum disorders. Recent major
advances have been made in the understanding of the neurobiology and functions of
fragile X mental retardation protein, the FMR1 gene product, which is absent or
reduced in FXS, largely based on work in the fmr1 knockout mouse model. FXS has
emerged as a disorder of synaptic plasticity associated with abnormalities of
long-term depression and long-term potentiation and immature dendritic spine
architecture, related to dysregulation of dendritic translation typically
activated by group I mGluR and other receptors. This work has led to efforts to
develop treatments for FXS with neuroactive molecules targeted to pathways
dysregulated in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein.
CONCLUSION: These agents have been shown to rescue molecular, spine, and
behavioral phenotypes in the FXS mouse model, and clinical trials are underway to
translate findings in animal models of FXS to humans, raising complex issues
about trial design and outcome measures to assess disease-modifying changes that 
might be associated with treatment. Genes known to be causes of autistic spectrum
disorders interact with the translational pathway defective in FXS and it is
likely that there will be substantial overlap in molecular pathways and
mechanisms of synaptic dysfunction. Thus targeted treatment and clinical trial
strategies in FXS may serve as a model for ASD and other cognitive disorders.

learning deficits in a fragile X model.

Fragile X syndrome, caused by the loss of Fmr1 gene function, is the most common 
form of inherited mental retardation, with no effective treatment. Using a
tractable animal model, we investigated mechanisms of action of a few
FDA-approved psychoactive drugs that modestly benefit the cognitive performance
in fragile X patients. Here we report that compounds activating serotonin (5HT)
subtype 2B receptors (5HT2B-Rs) or dopamine (DA) subtype 1-like receptors (D1-Rs)
and/or those inhibiting 5HT2A-Rs or D2-Rs moderately enhance Ras-PI3K/PKB
signaling input, GluA1-dependent synaptic plasticity, and learning in Fmr1
knockout mice. Unexpectedly, combinations of these 5HT and DA compounds at low
doses synergistically stimulate Ras-PI3K/PKB signal transduction and
GluA1-dependent synaptic plasticity and remarkably restore normal learning in
Fmr1 knockout mice without causing anxiety-related side effects. These findings
suggest that properly dosed and combined FDA-approved psychoactive drugs may
effectively treat the cognitive impairment associated with fragile X syndrome.

Large expansions of a CGG-repeat element (>200 repeats; full mutation) in the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause fragile X syndrome (FXS), the
leading single-gene form of intellectual disability and of autism spectrum
disorder. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; premutation) result in the
neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
Whereas FXS is caused by gene silencing and insufficient FMR1 protein (FMRP),
FXTAS is thought to be caused by 'toxicity' of expanded-CGG-repeat mRNA. However,
as FMRP expression levels decrease with increasing CGG-repeat length, lowered
protein may contribute to premutation-associated clinical involvement. To address
this issue, we measured brain Fmr1 mRNA and FMRP levels as a function of
CGG-repeat length in a congenic (CGG-repeat knock-in) mouse model using 57
wild-type and 97 expanded-CGG-repeat mice carrying up to ~250 CGG repeats. While 
Fmr1 message levels increased with repeat length, FMRP levels trended downward
over the same range, subject to significant inter-subject variation. Human
comparisons of protein levels in the frontal cortex of 7 normal and 17 FXTAS
individuals revealed that the mild FMRP decrease in mice mirrored the more
limited data for FMRP expression in the human samples. In addition, FMRP
expression levels varied in a subset of mice across the cerebellum, frontal
cortex, and hippocampus, as well as at different ages. These results provide a
foundation for understanding both the CGG-repeat-dependence of FMRP expression
and for interpreting clinical phenotypes in premutation carriers in terms of the 
balance between elevated mRNA and lowered FMRP expression levels.

Comment in
    Curr Biol. 2014 Aug 18;24(16):R755-7.

Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving
multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome
sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a
polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive 
mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include 
the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the
activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the
postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and
copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for
case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after
correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately
low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect.
Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can
discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in
neuropsychiatric disease.

Inherited alleles account for most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia.
However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number
changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes
encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations,
affecting one or a few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic
postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated
protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations are 
additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to modulate 
synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics and those
whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). 
Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those mutated in autism and 
intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic pathways. Aligning our 
findings with a parallel case-control study, we demonstrate reproducible insights
into aetiological mechanisms for schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared 
with other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are two small, related neuropeptide 
hormones found in many mammalian species, including humans. Dysregulation of
these neuropeptides have been associated with changes in behavior, especially
social interactions. We review how the OT and AVP systems have been investigated 
in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), Williams Syndrome
(WS) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS). All of these neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDD) are marked by social deficits. While PWS, WS and FXS have identified
genetic mutations, ASD stems from multiple genes with complex interactions.
Animal models of NDD are invaluable for studying the role and relatedness of OT
and AVP in the developing brain. We present data from a FXS mouse model affecting
the fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene, resulting in decreased OT and AVP
staining cells in some brain regions. Reviewing the research about OT and AVP in 
these NDD suggests that altered OT pathways may be downstream from different
etiological factors and perturbations in development. This has implications for
ongoing studies of the therapeutic application of OT in NDD. This article is part
of a Special Issue entitled Oxytocin and Social Behav.

A significant proportion of patients with autism exhibit some degree of
intellectual disability. The BTBR T(+) Itpr3(tf)/J mouse strain exhibits
behaviors that align with the major diagnostic criteria of autism. To further
evaluate the BTBR strain's cognitive impairments, we quantified
hippocampus-dependent object location memory (OLM) and found that one-third of
the BTBR mice exhibited robust memory, whereas the remainder did not.
Fluorescence deconvolution tomography was used to test whether synaptic levels of
activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), a protein that
contributes importantly to plasticity, correlate with OLM scores in individual
mice. In hippocampal field CA1, the BTBRs had fewer post-synaptic densities
associated with high levels of phosphorylated (p-) ERK1/2 as compared with
C57BL/6 mice. Although counts of p-ERK1/2 immunoreactive synapses did not
correlate with OLM performance, the intensity of synaptic p-ERK1/2 immunolabeling
was negatively correlated with OLM scores across BTBRs. Metabotropic glutamate
receptor (mGluR) 5 signaling activates ERK1/2. Therefore, we tested whether
treatment with the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP normalizes synaptic and learning
measures in BTBR mice: MPEP facilitated OLM and decreased synaptic p-ERK1/2
immunolabeling intensity without affecting numbers of p-ERK1/2+ synapses. In
contrast, semi-chronic ampakine treatment, which facilitates memory in other
models of cognitive impairment, had no effect on OLM in BTBRs. These results
suggest that intellectual disabilities associated with different
neurodevelopmental disorders on the autism spectrum require distinct therapeutic 
strategies based on underlying synaptic pathology.

Fragile X syndrome is a common inherited form of intellectual disability and
autism spectrum disorder. Most patients exhibit a massive CGG-repeat expansion
mutation in the FMR1 gene that silences the locus. In over two decades since the 
discovery of FMR1, only a single missense mutation (p.(Ile304Asn)) has been
reported as causing fragile X syndrome. Here we describe a 16-year-old male
presenting with fragile X syndrome but without the repeat expansion mutation.
Rather, we find a missense mutation, c.797G>A, that replaces glycine 266 with
glutamic acid (p.(Gly266Glu)). The Gly266Glu FMR protein abolished many
functional properties of the protein. This patient highlights the diagnostic
utility of FMR1 sequencing.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are heterogeneous disorders with a high
heritability and complex genetic architecture. Due to the central role of the
fragile X mental retardation gene 1 protein (FMRP) pathway in ASD we investigated
common functional variants of ASD risk genes regulating FMRP. We genotyped ten
SNPs in two German patient sets (N = 192 and N = 254 families, respectively) and 
report association for rs7170637 (CYFIP1; set 1 and combined sets), rs6923492
(GRM1; combined sets), and rs25925 (CAMK4; combined sets). An additional risk
score based on variants with an odds ratio (OR) >1.25 in set 1 and weighted by
their respective log transmitted/untransmitted ratio revealed a significant
effect (OR 1.30, 95 % CI 1.11-1.53; P = 0.0013) in the combined German sample. A 
subsequent meta-analysis including the two German samples, the "Strict/European" 
ASD subsample of the Autism Genome Project (1,466 families) and a French
case/control (541/366) cohort showed again association of rs7170637-A (OR 0.85,
95 % CI 0.75-0.96; P = 0.007) and rs25925-G (OR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.04-1.64; P =
0.021) with ASD. Functional analyses revealed that these minor alleles predicted 
to alter splicing factor binding sites significantly increase levels of an
alternative mRNA isoform of the respective gene while keeping the overall
expression of the gene constant. These findings underpin the role of ASD
candidate genes in postsynaptic FMRP regulation suggesting that an imbalance of
specific isoforms of CYFIP1, an FMRP interaction partner, and CAMK4, a
transcriptional regulator of the FMRP gene, modulates ASD risk. Both gene
products are related to neuronal regulation of synaptic plasticity, a

Physiological arousal in autism and fragile X syndrome: group comparisons and
links with pragmatic language.

Klusek J, Martin GE, Losh M.

This study tested the hypothesis that pragmatic (i.e., social) language
impairment is linked to arousal dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
and fragile X syndrome (FXS). Forty boys with ASD, 39 with FXS, and 27 with
typical development (TD), aged 4-15 years, participated. Boys with FXS were
hyperaroused compared to boys with TD but did not differ from boys with ASD.
Dampened vagal tone predicted pragmatic impairment in ASD, and associations
emerged between cardiac activity and receptive/expressive vocabulary across
groups. Findings support autonomic dysfunction as a mechanism underlying
pragmatic impairment in ASD and suggest that biophysiological profiles are shared
in ASD and FXS, which has implications for understanding the role of fragile X
mental retardation-1 (FMR1, the FXS gene) in the pathophysiology of ASD.

There is evidence which demonstrates that a subset of males with a premutation
CGG repeat expansion (between 55 and 200 repeats) of the fragile X mental
retardation 1 gene exhibit subtle deficits of executive function that
progressively deteriorate with increasing age and CGG repeat length. However, it 
remains unclear whether similar deficits, which may indicate the onset of more
severe degeneration, are evident in female PM-carriers. In the present study we
explore whether female PM-carriers exhibit deficits of executive function which
parallel those of male PM-carriers. Fourteen female fragile X premutation
carriers without fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and fourteen age,
sex, and IQ matched controls underwent ocular motor and neuropsychological tests 
of select executive processes, specifically of response inhibition and working
memory. Group comparisons revealed poorer inhibitory control for female
premutation carriers on ocular motor tasks, in addition to demonstrating some
difficulties in behaviour self-regulation, when compared to controls. A negative 
correlation between CGG repeat length and antisaccade error rates for premutation
carriers was also found. Our preliminary findings indicate that impaired
inhibitory control may represent a phenotype characteristic which may be a
sensitive risk biomarker within this female fragile X premutation population.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of FMR1 gene function, is the most
common heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. 
The FMR1 protein (FMRP) translational regulator mediates activity-dependent
control of synapses. In addition to the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)
hyperexcitation FXS theory, the GABA theory postulates that hypoinhibition is
causative for disease state symptoms. Here, we use the Drosophila FXS model to
assay central brain GABAergic circuitry, especially within the Mushroom Body (MB)
learning center. All 3 GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subunits are reportedly
downregulated in dfmr1 null brains. We demonstrate parallel downregulation of
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting GABA synthesis enzyme,
although GABAergic cell numbers appear unaffected. Mosaic analysis with a
repressible cell marker (MARCM) single-cell clonal studies show that dfmr1 null
GABAergic neurons innervating the MB calyx display altered architectural
development, with early underdevelopment followed by later overelaboration. In
addition, a new class of extra-calyx terminating GABAergic neurons is shown to
include MB intrinsic α/β Kenyon Cells (KCs), revealing a novel level of MB
inhibitory regulation. Functionally, dfmr1 null GABAergic neurons exhibit
elevated calcium signaling and altered kinetics in response to acute
depolarization. To test the role of these GABAergic changes, we attempted to
pharmacologically restore GABAergic signaling and assay effects on the
compromised MB-dependent olfactory learning in dfmr1 mutants, but found no
improvement. Our results show that GABAergic circuit structure and function are
impaired in the FXS disease state, but that correction of hypoinhibition alone is
not sufficient to rescue a behavioral learning impairment.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation 
and the leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by mutation in a single gene,
FMR1, which encodes an RNA-binding protein FMRP. FMRP is highly expressed in
neurons and is hypothesized to have a role in synaptic structure, function, and
plasticity by regulating mRNAs that encode pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Fmr1 
knockout (KO) mice have been used as a model to study FXS. These mice have been
reported to show a great degree of phenotypic variability based on the genetic
background, environmental signals, and experimental methods. In this study, we
sought to restrict FMRP deletion to two brain regions that have been implicated
in FXS and autism. We show that ablating Fmr1 in differentiated neurons of
hippocampus and cortex results in dendritic alterations and changes in synaptic
marker intensity that are brain region specific. In our conditional mutant mice, 
FMRP-deleted neurons have activated AKT-mTOR pathway signaling in hippocampus but
display no apparent behavioral phenotypes. These results highlight the importance
of identifying additional factors that interact with Fmr1 to develop FXS.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by a mutation of the FMR1 gene on
the X chromosome, is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability
and autism spectrum disorders. Comprehensive data are lacking, however, on the
characteristics and management patients with FXS in Germany.
METHODS/DESIGN: EXPLAIN is a prospective, observational, longitudinal registry
with a non-probability sampling approach. It collects data on patient
characteristics, therapeutic interventions, psychosocial parameters (including
those of family members and caregivers), quality of life of caregiver and
patient, caregiver burden, and health economic parameters, such as
hospitalisation time. It is designed to include data from 300 patients in
ambulatory care from about 50 centres that employ psychiatrists, paediatricians, 
neurologists, and other relevant specialists, in Germany. The study was initiated
in March, 2013. Patients will be followed for at least two years.
DISCUSSION: The registry is expected to provide much-needed data on the
characteristics and management of patients with FXS in Germany. It will also
allow comparisons with other countries, and will enable gap analyses based on
current guidelines for management of these patients.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT01711606.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is encoded by Fmr1 gene in which
mutation is known to cause fragile X syndrome characterized by mental impairment 
and other psychiatric symptoms similar to autism spectrum disorders. FMRP plays
important roles in cellular mRNA biology such as transport, stability, and
translation as an RNA-binding protein. In the present study, we identified
potential role of FMRP in the neural differentiation, using cortical neural
progenitor cells from Sprague-Dawley rat. We newly found NeuroD1, an essential
regulator of glutamatergic neuronal differentiation, as a new mRNA target
interacting with FMRP in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We also identified
FMRP as a regulator of neuronal differentiation by modulating NeuroD1 expression.
Down-regulation of FMRP by siRNA also increased NeuroD1 expression along with
increased pre- and post-synaptic development of glutamatergic neuron, as
evidenced by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. On the contrary, cells
harboring FMRP over-expression construct showed decreased NeuroD1 expression.
Treatment of cultured neural precursor cells with a histone deacetylase
inhibitor, valproic acid known as an inducer of hyper-glutamatergic neuronal
differentiation, down-regulated the expression of FMRP, and induced NeuroD1
expression. Our study suggests that modulation of FMRP expression regulates
neuronal differentiation by interaction with its binding target mRNA, and
provides an example of the gene and environmental interaction regulating
glutamatergic neuronal differentiation.

Neuronal dendrites are structurally and functionally dynamic in response to
changes in afferent activity. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is 
an mRNA binding protein that regulates activity-dependent protein synthesis and
morphological dynamics of dendrites. Loss and abnormal expression of FMRP occur
in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and some forms of autism spectrum disorders. To
provide further understanding of how FMRP signaling regulates dendritic dynamics,
we examined dendritic expression and localization of FMRP in the reptilian and
avian nucleus laminaris (NL) and its mammalian analogue, the medial superior
olive (MSO), in rodents and humans. NL/MSO neurons are specialized for temporal
processing of low-frequency sounds for binaural hearing, which is impaired in
FXS. Protein BLAST analyses first demonstrate that the FMRP amino acid sequences 
in the alligator and chicken are highly similar to human FMRP with identical
mRNA-binding and phosphorylation sites, suggesting that FMRP functions similarly 
across vertebrates. Immunocytochemistry further reveals that NL/MSO neurons have 
very high levels of dendritic FMRP in low-frequency hearing vertebrates including
alligator, chicken, gerbil, and human. Remarkably, dendritic FMRP in NL/MSO
neurons often accumulates at branch points and enlarged distal tips, loci known
to be critical for branch-specific dendritic arbor dynamics. These observations
support an important role for FMRP in regulating dendritic properties of binaural
neurons that are essential for low-frequency sound localization and auditory
scene segregation, and support the relevance of studying this regulation in
nonhuman vertebrates that use low frequencies in order to further understand
human auditory processing disorders.

BACKGROUND: Austism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous behavioral
disorder or condition characterized by severe impairment of social engagement and
the presence of repetitive activities. The molecular etiology of ASD is still
largely unknown despite a strong genetic component. Part of the difficulty in
turning genetics into disease mechanisms and potentially new therapeutics is the 
sheer number and diversity of the genes that have been associated with ASD and
ASD symptoms. The goal of this work is to use shRNA-generated models of genetic
defects proposed as causative for ASD to identify the common pathways that might 
explain how they produce a core clinical disability.
METHODS: Transcript levels of Mecp2, Mef2a, Mef2d, Fmr1, Nlgn1, Nlgn3, Pten, and 
Shank3 were knocked-down in mouse primary neuron cultures using shRNA constructs.
Whole genome expression analysis was conducted for each of the knockdown cultures
as well as a mock-transduced culture and a culture exposed to a lentivirus
expressing an anti-luciferase shRNA. Gene set enrichment and a causal reasoning
engine was employed to identify pathway level perturbations generated by the
transcript knockdown.
RESULTS: Quantification of the shRNA targets confirmed the successful knockdown
at the transcript and protein levels of at least 75% for each of the genes. After
subtracting out potential artifacts caused by viral infection, gene set
enrichment and causal reasoning engine analysis showed that a significant number 
of gene expression changes mapped to pathways associated with neurogenesis,
long-term potentiation, and synaptic activity.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that despite the complex genetic nature of
ASD, there are common molecular mechanisms that connect many of the best
established autism candidate genes. By identifying the key regulatory checkpoints
in the interlinking transcriptional networks underlying autism, we are better
able to discover the ideal points of intervention that provide the broadest
efficacy across the diverse population of autism patients.

Fragile X syndrome: a preclinical review on metabotropic glutamate receptor 5
(mGluR5) antagonists and drug development.

Pop AS, Gomez-Mancilla B, Neri G, Willemsen R, Gasparini F.

RATIONALE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is considered the leading inherited cause of 
intellectual disability and autism. In FXS, the fragile X mental retardation 1
(FMR1) gene is silenced and the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is
not expressed, resulting in the characteristic features of the syndrome. Despite 
recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of FXS, there is still no
cure for this condition; current treatment is symptomatic. Preclinical research
is essential in the development of potential therapeutic agents.
OBJECTIVES: This review provides an overview of the preclinical evidence
supporting metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonists as therapeutic 
agents for FXS.
RESULTS: According to the mGluR theory of FXS, the absence of FMRP leads to
enhanced glutamatergic signaling via mGluR5, which leads to increased protein
synthesis and defects in synaptic plasticity including enhanced long-term
depression. As such, efforts to develop agents that target the underlying
pathophysiology of FXS have focused on mGluR5 modulation. Animal models,
particularly the Fmr1 knockout mouse model, have become invaluable in exploring
therapeutic approaches on an electrophysiological, behavioral, biochemical, and
neuroanatomical level. Two direct approaches are currently being investigated for
FXS treatment: reactivating the FMR1 gene and compensating for the lack of FMRP. 
The latter approach has yielded promising results, with mGluR5 antagonists
showing efficacy in clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting mGluR5 is a valid approach for the development of
therapeutic agents that target the underlying pathophysiology of FXS. Several
compounds are currently in development, with encouraging results.

The fmr1 knock out (KO) mouse has been a useful animal model to understand
pathology and treatment of FXS, both anatomically and behaviorally. Ultrasonic
vocalizations (USVs) are a behavioral tool to assess early life communication
deficits in mice. Here, we report on the temporal and spectral features of USVs
emitted after maternal separation in wild type (FVB/N) and fmr1 KO pups at
postnatal days (P) P4, P7 and P10. The results show changes in the number and
duration of calls in fmr1 KO pups and wild type pups were dependent on age and
call type. Fmr1 KO pups showed an increased number of USVs at P7 but not at P4 or
P10. This increase was specific to Frequency Jump calls. In addition, fmr1 KO
mice showed a developmental shift in the temporal distribution of calls, with P10
mice calling in distinct bout patterns. Overall, these findings provide evidence 
that changes in USV outcomes were specific to certain call types and ages in fmr1
KO mice. Because early postnatal life is a window during which multiple neural
systems activate and become established, behavioral measures such as using USVs
as a measure of communication, may be useful as a predictor of brain changes and 
later developmental behavioral changes. Work is needed to better understand the
functional outcomes of altered development of USVs and how these changes
contribute to later emergence of autistic-like behaviors in animal models of
autism.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable complex neurodevelopmental
condition characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication
and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Although roles for both de novo and
familial genetic variation have been documented, the underlying disease
mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. In this study, we defined and explored
distinct etiologies of genetic variants that affect genes regulated by Fragile-X 
mental retardation protein (FMRP), thought to play a key role in neuroplasticity 
and neuronal translation, in ASD-affected individuals. In particular, we
developed the Trend test, a pathway-association test that is able to robustly
detect multiple-hit etiologies and is more powerful than existing approaches.
Exploiting detailed spatiotemporal maps of gene expression within the human
brain, we identified four discrete FMRP-target subpopulations that exhibit
distinct functional biases and contribute to ASD via different types of genetic
variation. We also demonstrated that FMRP target genes are more likely than other
genes with similar expression patterns to contribute to disease. We developed the
hypothesis that FMRP targets contribute to ASD via two distinct etiologies: (1)
ultra-rare and highly penetrant single disruptions of embryonically upregulated
FMRP targets ("single-hit etiology") or (2) the combination of multiple less
penetrant disruptions of nonembryonic, synaptic FMRP targets ("multiple-hit
etiology"). The Trend test provides rigorous support for a multiple-hit genetic
etiology in a subset of autism cases and is easily extendible to combining
information from multiple types of genetic variation (i.e., copy-number and exome
variants), increasing its value to next-generation sequencing approaches.

RATIONALE: Advances in understanding the underlying mechanisms of conditions such
as fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorders have revealed
heterogeneous populations. Recent trials of novel FXS therapies have highlighted 
several challenges including subpopulations with possibly differential
therapeutic responses, the lack of specific outcome measures capturing the full
range of improvements of patients with FXS, and a lack of biomarkers that can
track whether a specific mechanism is responsive to a new drug and whether the
response correlates with clinical improvement.
OBJECTIVES: We review the phenotypic heterogeneity of FXS and the implications
for clinical research in FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
RESULTS: Residual levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
expression explain in part the heterogeneity in the FXS phenotype; studies
indicate a correlation with both cognitive and behavioral deficits. However, this
does not fully explain the extent of phenotypic variance observed or the
variability of drug response. Post hoc analyses of studies involving the
selective mGluR5 antagonist mavoglurant and the GABAB agonist arbaclofen have
uncovered significant therapeutic responses following patient stratification
according to FMR1 promoter methylation patterns or baseline severity of social
withdrawal, respectively. Future studies designed to quantify disease
modification will need to develop new strategies to track changes effectively
over time and in multiple symptom domains.
CONCLUSION: Appropriate selection of patients and outcome measures is central to 
optimizing future clinical investigations of these complex disorders.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited mental retardation
and autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of FMR1, which encodes the
translational repressor fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP and
cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), an activator of
translation, are present in neuronal dendrites, are predicted to bind many of the
same mRNAs and may mediate a translational homeostasis that, when imbalanced,
results in FXS. Consistent with this possibility, Fmr1(-/y); Cpeb1(-/-)
double-knockout mice displayed amelioration of biochemical, morphological,
electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes associated with FXS. Acute
depletion of CPEB1 in the hippocampus of adult Fmr1(-/y) mice rescued working
memory deficits, demonstrating reversal of this FXS phenotype. Finally, we find
that FMRP and CPEB1 balance translation at the level of polypeptide elongation.
Our results suggest that disruption of translational homeostasis is causal for
FXS and that the maintenance of this homeostasis by FMRP and CPEB1 is necessary
for normal neurologic function.

Vergata, Italy.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual
disability and autism. The FMR1 gene contains a CGG repeat present in the
5'-untranslated region which can be unstable upon transmission to the next
generation. The repeat is up to 55 CGGs long in the normal population. In
patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a repeat length exceeding 200 CGGs
generally leads to methylation of the repeat and the promoter region, which is
accompanied by silencing of the FMR1 gene. The disease is a result of lack of
expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein leading to severe
symptoms, including intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and autistic-like
behavior. The FMR1 protein (FMRP) has a number of functions. The translational
dysregulation of a subset of mRNAs targeted by FMRP is probably the major
contribution to FXS. FMRP is also involved in mRNA transport to synapses where
protein synthesis occurs. For some FMRP-bound mRNAs, FMRP is a direct modulator
of mRNA stability either by sustaining or preventing mRNA decay. Increased
knowledge about the role of FMRP has led to the identification of potential
treatments for fragile X syndrome that were often tested first in the different
animal models. This review gives an overview about the present knowledge of the
function of FMRP and the therapeutic strategies in mouse and man.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most frequent causes of mental
retardation, intellectual disability, and autism. Most cases are the result of an
expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the
FMR1 gene and the subsequent functional loss of the related protein. We describe 
the case of a 4-year-old boy who clinically presents mild psychomotor delay
without any major clinical dysmorphisms. Molecular analysis of the FMR1 gene
showed mosaicism in terms of size and methylation, with one normal and 1 fully
mutated allele, which is very rare in this syndrome. Physicians should therefore 
consider a diagnosis of FXS even if the patient's phenotype is mild. Although
rare, diagnosing this condition has important consequences for the patient's
rehabilitation and the family planning of parents and relatives.

The CYFIP1/SRA1 gene is located in a chromosomal region linked to various
neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, autism, and
schizophrenia. CYFIP1 plays a dual role in two apparently unrelated processes,
inhibiting local protein synthesis and favoring actin remodeling. Here, we show
that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-driven synaptic signaling releases 
CYFIP1 from the translational inhibitory complex, triggering translation of
target mRNAs and shifting CYFIP1 into the WAVE regulatory complex. Active Rac1
alters the CYFIP1 conformation, as demonstrated by intramolecular FRET, and is
key in changing the equilibrium of the two complexes. CYFIP1 thus orchestrates
the two molecular cascades, protein translation and actin polymerization, each of
which is necessary for correct spine morphology in neurons. The CYFIP1
interactome reveals many interactors associated with brain disorders, opening new
perspectives to define regulatory pathways shared by neurological disabilities
characterized by spine dysmorphogenesis.

Fragile X mental retardation protein regulates trans-synaptic signaling in
Drosophila.

Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37212, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited determinant of intellectual
disability and autism spectrum disorders, is caused by loss of the fragile X
mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene product (FMRP), an mRNA-binding translational
repressor. A number of conserved FMRP targets have been identified in the
well-characterized Drosophila FXS disease model, but FMRP is highly pleiotropic
in function and the full spectrum of FMRP targets has yet to be revealed. In this
study, screens for upregulated neural proteins in Drosophila fmr1 (dfmr1) null
mutants reveal strong elevation of two synaptic heparan sulfate proteoglycans
(HSPGs): GPI-anchored glypican Dally-like protein (Dlp) and transmembrane
Syndecan (Sdc). Our recent work has shown that Dlp and Sdc act as co-receptors
regulating extracellular ligands upstream of intracellular signal transduction in
multiple trans-synaptic pathways that drive synaptogenesis. Consistently, dfmr1
null synapses exhibit altered WNT signaling, with changes in both Wingless (Wg)
ligand abundance and downstream Frizzled-2 (Fz2) receptor C-terminal nuclear
import. Similarly, a parallel anterograde signaling ligand, Jelly belly (Jeb),
and downstream ERK phosphorylation (dpERK) are depressed at dfmr1 null synapses. 
In contrast, the retrograde BMP ligand Glass bottom boat (Gbb) and downstream
signaling via phosphorylation of the transcription factor MAD (pMAD) seem not to 
be affected. To determine whether HSPG upregulation is causative for synaptogenic
defects, HSPGs were genetically reduced to control levels in the dfmr1 null
background. HSPG correction restored both (1) Wg and Jeb trans-synaptic
signaling, and (2) synaptic architecture and transmission strength back to
wild-type levels. Taken together, these data suggest that FMRP negatively
regulates HSPG co-receptors controlling trans-synaptic signaling during
synaptogenesis, and that loss of this regulation causes synaptic structure and
function defects characterizing the FXS disease state.

Developmental changes in expression of inhibitory neuronal proteins in the
Fragile X Syndrome mouse basolateral amygdala.

Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.

In humans, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is characterized by enhanced fear,
hyperactivity, social anxiety, and, in a subset of individuals, autism. Many of
the emotional and social deficits point to defects in the amygdala. We have
previously shown defects in inhibitory neuron drive onto excitatory projection
neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of juvenile Fmr1(-/y) knockout (KO)
mice. Using pharmacological approaches, we have also previously revealed dynamic 
functional deficits in α1, α2, and α3 subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs
α1, α2, and α3) during early postnatal development. In this study, we sought to
determine whether these defects in GABAAR function are accompanied by changes in 
protein expression of GABAARs α1, α2, and α3 and the post-synaptic
GABAAR-clustering protein gephyrin. Interestingly, we found that while the
expression of these proteins did not significantly differ between wildtype (WT)
and KO mice at each time point, the timing of developmental expression of GABAAR 
α1, α2, and gephyrin was altered. Collectively, these data reveal novel defects
in inhibitory synapse protein expression during critical periods of early
postnatal development that could contribute to observed inhibitory
neurotransmission deficits in the KO mouse BLA.

Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy
disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de
novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies:
infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced
the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo
mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations
in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation 
in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo 
mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two
patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with
epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the
probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P =
7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort
include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and
NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in
specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein
(P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.

Towards identification of individual etiologies by resolving genomic and
biological conundrums in patients with autism spectrum disorders.

Recent genomic research into autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has revealed a
remarkably complex genetic architecture. Large numbers of common variants, copy
number variations and single nucleotide variants have been identified, yet each
of them individually afforded only a small phenotypic impact. A polygenic model
in which multiple genes interact either in an additive or a synergistic way
appears the most plausible for the majority of ASD patients. Based on recently
identified ASD candidate genes, transgenic mouse models for
neuroligins/neurorexins and genes such as Cntnap2, Cntn5, Tsc1, Tsc2, Akt3,
Cyfip1, Scn1a, En2, Slc6a4, and Bckdk have been generated and studied with
respect to behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotypes and sensitivity to drug
treatments. From these models, a few clues for potential pharmacologic
intervention emerged. The Fmr1, Shank2 and Cntn5 knockout mice exhibited
alterations of glutamate receptors, which may become a target for pharmacologic
modulation. Some of the phenotypes of Mecp2 knockout mice can be ameliorated by
administering IGF1. In the near future, comprehensive genotyping of individual
patients and siblings combined with the novel insights generated from the
transgenic animal studies may provide us with personalized treatment options.
Eventually, autism may indeed turn out to be a phenotypically heterogeneous group
of disorders ('autisms') caused by combinations of changes in multiple possible
candidate genes, being different in each patient and requiring for each
combination of mutations a distinct, individually tailored treatment.

Advances in clinical and molecular understanding of the FMR1 premutation and
fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.

Davis, School of Medicine, Davis, CA, USA.

Fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable form of cognitive impairment, is
caused by epigenetic silencing of the fragile X (FMR1) gene owing to large
expansions (>200 repeats) of a non-coding CGG-repeat element. Smaller, so-called 
premutation expansions (55-200 repeats) can cause a family of neurodevelopmental 
phenotypes (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder,
seizure disorder) and neurodegenerative (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia
syndrome [FXTAS]) phenotypes through an entirely distinct molecular mechanism
involving increased FMR1 mRNA production and toxicity. Results of basic cellular,
animal, and human studies have helped to elucidate the underlying RNA toxicity
mechanism, while clinical research is providing a more nuanced picture of the
range of clinical manifestations. Advances of knowledge on both mechanistic and
clinical fronts are driving new approaches to targeted treatment, but two
important necessities are emerging: to define the extent to which the mechanisms 
contributing to FXTAS also contribute to other neurodegenerative and medical
disorders, and to redefine FXTAS in view of its differing presentations and
associated features.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) demonstrates high heritability and familial
clustering, yet the genetic causes remain only partially understood as a result
of extensive clinical and genomic heterogeneity. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
shows promise as a tool for identifying ASD risk genes as well as unreported
mutations in known loci, but an assessment of its full utility in an ASD group
has not been performed. We used WGS to examine 32 families with ASD to detect de 
novo or rare inherited genetic variants predicted to be deleterious
(loss-of-function and damaging missense mutations). Among ASD probands, we
identified deleterious de novo mutations in six of 32 (19%) families and X-linked
or autosomal inherited alterations in ten of 32 (31%) families (some had
combinations of mutations). The proportion of families identified with such
putative mutations was larger than has been previously reported; this yield was
in part due to the comprehensive and uniform coverage afforded by WGS.
Deleterious variants were found in four unrecognized, nine known, and eight
candidate ASD risk genes. Examples include CAPRIN1 and AFF2 (both linked to FMR1,
which is involved in fragile X syndrome), VIP (involved in social-cognitive
deficits), and other genes such as SCN2A and KCNQ2 (linked to epilepsy), NRXN1,
and CHD7, which causes ASD-associated CHARGE syndrome. Taken together, these
results suggest that WGS and thorough bioinformatic analyses for de novo and rare
inherited mutations will improve the detection of genetic variants likely to be
associated with ASD or its accompanying clinical symptoms.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that
targets ∼5% of all mRNAs expressed in the brain. Previous work by our laboratory 
demonstrated significantly lower protein levels for FMRP in lateral cerebella of 
subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression when compared 
with controls. Absence of FMRP expression in animal models of fragile X syndrome 
(FXS) has been shown to reduce expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)
receptor mRNAs. Previous work by our laboratory has found reduced expression of
FMRP, as well as multiple GABAA and GABAB receptor subunits in subjects with
autism. Less is known about levels for GABAA subunit protein expression in brains
of subjects with schizophrenia and mood disorders. In the current study, we have 
expanded our previous studies to examine the protein and mRNA expression of two
novel GABAA receptors, theta (GABRθ) and rho 2 (GABRρ2) as well as FMRP, and
metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in lateral cerebella of subjects with 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and healthy controls, and in
superior frontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9 (BA9)) of subjects with schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder and healthy controls. We observed multiple statistically
significant mRNA and protein changes in levels of GABRθ, GABRρ2, mGluR5 and FMRP 
molecules including concordant reductions in mRNA and proteins for GABRθ and
mGluR5 in lateral cerebella of subjects with schizophrenia; for increased mRNA
and protein for GABRρ2 in lateral cerebella of subjects with bipolar disorder;
and for reduced mRNA and protein for mGluR5 in BA9 of subjects with bipolar
disorder. There were no significant effects of confounds on any of the results.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability in males and the most common genetic cause of autism. Although
executive dysfunction is consistently found in humans with FXS, evidence of
executive dysfunction in Fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model of FXS, has been
inconsistent. One possible explanation for this is that executive dysfunction in 
Fmr1 KO mice, similar to humans with FXS, is only evident when cognitive demands 
are high. Using touchscreen operant conditioning chambers, male Fmr1 KO mice and 
their male wildtype littermates were tested on the acquisition of a pairwise
visual discrimination followed by four serial reversals of the response rule. We 
assessed reversal learning performance under two different conditions. In the
first, the correct stimulus was salient and the incorrect stimulus was
non-salient. In the second and more challenging condition, the incorrect stimulus
was salient and the correct stimulus was non-salient; this increased cognitive
load by introducing conflict between sensory-driven (i.e., bottom-up) and
task-dependent (i.e., top-down) signals. Fmr1 KOs displayed two distinct
impairments relative to wildtype littermates. First, Fmr1 KOs committed
significantly more learning-type errors during the second reversal stage, but
only under high cognitive load. Second, during the first reversal stage, Fmr1 KOs
committed significantly more attempts to collect a reward during the timeout
following an incorrect response. These findings indicate that Fmr1 KO mice
display executive dysfunction that, in some cases, is only evident under high
cognitive load.

Delayed myelination in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.

Pacey LK, Xuan IC, Guan S, Sussman D, Henkelman RM, Chen Y, Thomsen C, Hampson
DR.

Fragile X Syndrome is the most common inherited cause of autism. Fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent in fragile X, is an mRNA binding
protein that regulates the translation of hundreds of different mRNA transcripts.
In the adult brain, FMRP is expressed primarily in the neurons; however, it is
also expressed in developing glial cells, where its function is not well
understood. Here, we show that fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mice display
abnormalities in the myelination of cerebellar axons as early as the first
postnatal week, corresponding roughly to the equivalent time in human brain
development when symptoms of the syndrome first become apparent (1-3 years of
age). At postnatal day (PND) 7, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging
showed reduced volume of the Fmr1 cerebellum compared with wild-type mice,
concomitant with an 80-85% reduction in the expression of myelin basic protein,
fewer myelinated axons and reduced thickness of myelin sheaths, as measured by
electron microscopy. Both the expression of the proteoglycan NG2 and the number
of PDGFRα+/NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells were reduced in the Fmr1
cerebellum at PND 7. Although myelin proteins were still depressed at PND 15,
they regained wild-type levels by PND 30. These findings suggest that impaired
maturation or function of oligodendrocyte precursor cells induces delayed
myelination in the Fmr1 mouse brain. Our results bolster an emerging recognition 
that white matter abnormalities in early postnatal brain development represent an
underlying neurological deficit in Fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic disorder that is caused by the absence of
FMR1 protein (FMRP). FXS serves as an excellent model disorder for studies
investigating disturbed molecular mechanisms and synapse function underlying
cognitive impairment, autism, and behavioral disturbance. Abnormalities in
dendritic spines and synaptic transmission in the brain of FXS individuals and
mouse models for FXS indicate perturbations in the development, maintenance, and 
plasticity of neuronal network connectivity. However, numerous alterations are
found during the early development in FXS, including abnormal differentiation of 
neural progenitors and impaired migration of newly born neurons. Several aspects 
of FMRP function are modulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
signaling. Here, we review the evidence of the role for BDNF in the developing
and adult FXS brain. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'BDNF
Regulation of Synaptic Structure, Function, and Plasticity'.

Increasing our understanding of human cognition through the study of Fragile X
Syndrome.

Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is considered the most common form of inherited
intellectual disability. It is caused by reductions in the expression level or
function of a single protein, the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a 
translational regulator which binds to approximately 4% of brain messenger RNAs. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that FXS is a complex disorder of cognition,
involving interactions between genetic and environmental influences, leading to
difficulties in acquiring key life skills including motor skills, language, and
proper social behaviors. Since many FXS patients also present with one or more
features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), insights gained from studying the
monogenic basis of FXS could pave the way to a greater understanding of
underlying features of multigenic ASDs. Here we present an overview of the FXS
and FMRP field with the goal of demonstrating how loss of a single protein
involved in translational control affects multiple stages of brain development
and leads to debilitating consequences on human cognition. We also focus on
studies which have rescued or improved FXS symptoms in mice using genetic or
therapeutic approaches to reduce protein expression. We end with a brief
description of how deficits in translational control are implicated in FXS and
certain cases of ASDs, with many recent studies demonstrating that ASDs are
likely caused by increases or decreases in the levels of certain key synaptic
proteins. The study of FXS and its underlying single genetic cause offers an
invaluable opportunity to study how a single gene influences brain development
and behavior.

Fragile X syndrome, the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and autism 
spectrum disorders worldwide, is caused by a tandem repeat expansion in the FMR1 
(fragile X mental retardation 1) gene. It presents with a distinct behavioral
phenotype which overlaps significantly with that of autism. Emerging evidence
suggests that tandem repeat polymorphisms (TRPs) might also play a key role in
modulating disease susceptibility for a range of common polygenic disorders,
including the broader autism spectrum of disorders (ASD) and other forms of
psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder [1]. 
In order to understand how TRPs and associated gene mutations mediate
pathogenesis, various mouse models have been generated. A crucial step in such
functional genomics is high-quality behavioral and cognitive phenotyping. This
chapter presents a basic behavioral battery for standardized tests for assaying
social phenotypes in mouse models of brain disorders, with a focus on aggression.

Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and is
frequently associated with autism. The syndrome is due to mutations of the FMR1
gene that result in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).
We have developed a rapid, highly sensitive method for quantifying FMRP from
dried blood spots and lymphocytes. This assay uses two new antibodies, a
bacterially expressed abbreviated FMRP standard, and a Luminex platform to
quantify FMRP. The assay readily distinguished between samples from males with
fragile X full mutations and samples from normal males. It also differentiated
mosaic from nonmosaic full-mutation male samples. This assay, because of its
methodology and minimal cost, could be the basis for newborn or population
screening.

mice.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common single-gene inherited form of
intellectual disability with behaviors characteristic of autism. People with FXS 
display childhood seizures, hyperactivity, anxiety, developmental delay,
attention deficits, and visual-spatial memory impairment, as well as a propensity
for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Several of these aberrant behaviors and
FXS-associated synaptic irregularities also occur in "fragile X mental
retardation gene" knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice. We previously reported that
minocycline promotes the maturation of dendritic spines - postsynaptic sites for 
excitatory synapses - in the developing hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice, which may
underlie the beneficial effects of minocycline on anxiolytic behavior in young
Fmr1 KO mice. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of minocycline
treatment in young and adult Fmr1 KO mice, and determined the dependence of
behavioral improvements on short-term versus long-term minocycline
administration. We found that 4- and 8-week-long treatments significantly reduced
locomotor activity in both young and adult Fmr1 KO mice. Some behavioral
improvements persisted in young mice post-treatment, but in adults the beneficial
effects were lost soon after minocycline treatment was stopped. We also show, for
the first time, that minocycline treatment partially attenuates the number and
severity of audiogenic seizures in Fmr1 KO mice. This report provides further
evidence that minocycline treatment has immediate and long-lasting benefits on
FXS-associated behaviors in the Fmr1 KO mouse model.

BACKGROUND: Hypermethylation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene FMR1
results in decreased expression of FMR1 protein FMRP, which is the underlying
cause of Fragile X syndrome - an incurable neurological disorder characterized by
mental retardation, anxiety, epileptic episodes and autism. Disease-modifying
therapies for Fragile X syndrome are thus aimed at treatments that increase the
FMRP expression levels in the brain. We describe the development and
characterization of two assays for simple and quantitative detection of FMRP
protein.
METHOD: Antibodies coupled to fluorophores that can be employed for time-resolved
Förster's resonance energy transfer were used for the development of homogeneous,
one-step immunodetection. Purified recombinant human FMRP and patient cells were 
used as control samples for assay development.
RESULTS: The assays require small sample amounts, display high stability and
reproducibility and can be used to quantify endogenous FMRP in human fibroblasts 
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Application of the assays to FXS patient 
cells showed that the methods can be used both for the characterization of
clinical FXS patient samples as well as primary readouts in drug-discovery
screens aimed at increasing endogenous FMRP levels in human cells.
CONCLUSION: This study provides novel quantitative detection methods for FMRP in 
FXS patient cells. Importantly, due to the simplicity of the assay protocol, the 
method is suited to be used in screening applications to identify compounds or
genetic interventions that result in increased FMRP levels in human cells.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of inherited
intellectual disability and autism, is caused by the silencing of the FMR1 gene, 
leading to the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a
synaptically expressed RNA-binding protein regulating translation. The Fmr1
knockout model recapitulates the main traits of the disease. Uncontrolled
activity of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling seem crucial in the pathology of this disease. The
endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity, cognitive
performance, anxiety, nociception and seizure susceptibility, all of which are
affected in FXS. The cannabinoid receptors CB1 (CB1R) and CB2 (CB2R) are
activated by phospholipid-derived endocannabinoids, and CB1R-driven long-term
regulation of synaptic strength, as a consequence of mGluR5 activation, is
altered in several brain areas of Fmr1 knockout mice. We found that CB1R blockade
in male Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1(-/y)) mice through pharmacological and genetic
approaches normalized cognitive impairment, nociceptive desensitization,
susceptibility to audiogenic seizures, overactivated mTOR signaling and altered
spine morphology, whereas pharmacological blockade of CB2R normalized
anxiolytic-like behavior. Some of these traits were also reversed by
pharmacological inhibition of mTOR or mGluR5. Thus, blockade of ECS is a
potential therapeutic approach to normalize specific alterations in FXS.

Recent evidence suggests that there are age-related neurocognitive implications
for fragile X premutation carriers, including deficits in executive function, and
that such deficits are more common in male than female premutation carriers. The 
purpose of the current study is to examine one aspect of executive function,
language dysfluencies, in a group of 193 women with the premutation, and to
contrast them with a comparison group (mothers of children with autism spectrum
disorders). Our results demonstrate a linguistic profile in the female
premutation carriers characterized by dysfluencies associated with deficits in
organization and planning, with a clear impact of age. The comparison group,
matched on both age and education level, did not demonstrate the age effect. Our 
results suggest dysfluencies could be an early indicator of cognitive aging in
some female premutation carriers, and could be used to target early intervention.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of autism and
intellectual disability and is caused by the silencing of a single gene, fragile 
X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1). The Fmr1 KO mouse displays phenotypes similar to
symptoms in the human condition--including hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors,
and seizures--as well as analogous abnormalities in the density of dendritic
spines. Here we take a hypothesis-driven, mechanism-based approach to the search 
for an effective therapy for FXS. We hypothesize that a treatment that rescues
the dendritic spine defect in Fmr1 KO mice may also ameliorate autism-like
behavioral symptoms. Thus, we targeted a protein that regulates spines through
modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics: p21-activated kinase (PAK). Our
results demonstrate that a potent small molecule inhibitor of group I PAKs
reverses dendritic spine phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, this PAK
inhibitor--which we call FRAX486--also rescues seizures and behavioral
abnormalities such as hyperactivity and repetitive movements, thereby supporting 
the hypothesis that a drug treatment that reverses the spine abnormalities can
also treat neurological and behavioral symptoms. Finally, a single administration
of FRAX486 is sufficient to rescue all of these phenotypes in adult Fmr1 KO mice,
demonstrating the potential for rapid, postdiagnostic therapy in adults with FXS.

Syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and its associated disorders are caused by
the expansion of the CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X
mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, with disease classification based on the number
of CGG repeats. The mechanisms of repeat expansion are dependent on the presence 
of cis elements and the absence of trans factors both of which are not mutually
exclusive and contribute to repeat instability. Expansions associated with trans 
factors are due to the haploinsuffient or reduced expression of several DNA
repair/metabolizing proteins. The reduction of expression in trans factors has
been primarily conducted in animal models without substantial examination of many
of these expansion mechanisms and trans factors in humans.
RESULTS: To understand the trans factors and pathways associated with
trinucleotide repeat expansion we have analyzed two microarray datasets which
characterized the transcript expression in patients with FXS and in controls.
CONCLUSION: We observed significant down regulation of DNA damage/repair pathway 
transcripts. This observation was consistent in both datasets, which used
different populations. Within these datasets, several transcripts overlapped in
the direction of association and fold change. Further characterization of these
genes will be critical to understand their role in trinucleotide repeat
instability in FXS.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant monogenetic disorder
that is characterized by the formation of benign tumors in several organs as well
as brain malformations and neuronal defects. TSC is caused by inactivating
mutations in one of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, resulting in increased activity of 
the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). Here, we explore the cytoarchitectural 
and functional CNS aberrations that may account for the neurological
presentations of TSC, notably seizures, hydrocephalus, and cognitive and
psychological impairments. In particular, recent mouse models of brain lesions
are presented with an emphasis on using electroporation to allow the generation
of discrete lesions resulting from loss of heterozygosity during perinatal
development. Cortical lesions are thought to contribute to epileptogenesis and
worsening of cognitive defects. However, it has recently been suggested that
being born with a mutant allele without loss of heterozygosity and associated
cortical lesions is sufficient to generate cognitive and neuropsychiatric
problems. We will thus discuss the function of mTOR hyperactivity on neuronal
circuit formation and the potential consequences of being born heterozygous on
neuronal function and the biochemistry of synaptic plasticity, the cellular
substrate of learning and memory. Ultimately, a major goal of TSC research is to 
identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms downstream of mTOR underlying the 
neurological manifestations observed in TSC patients and identify novel
therapeutic targets to prevent the formation of brain lesions and restore
neuronal function.

An investigation of narrative ability in boys with autism and fragile X syndrome.

Whereas pragmatic language difficulties are characteristic of both autism and
Fragile X syndrome, it is unclear whether such deficits are qualitatively similar
or whether certain skills are differentially affected. This study compared
narrative competence in boys with autism, Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and 
typical development. Results revealed that an interaction between diagnosis and
nonverbal mental age predicted narrative microstructure (e.g., complex syntax)
but not macrostructure (e.g., thematic maintenance). Correlations with
FMR1-related variation were investigated in children with Fragile X syndrome.
While CGG repeat length was associated with many language characteristics,
nonverbal IQ appeared to mediate these relationships. These findings are an
important step toward understanding narrative abilities in boys with and without 
the FMR1 mutation.

Altered auditory processing in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.

Rotschafer S(1), Razak K.

Author information:

California, Riverside, CA, USA.

This study provides the first description of auditory cortical processing in a
mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is a genetic cause of intellectual
impairment and is an autism spectrum disorder. Human studies with auditory evoked
potentials indicate that FXS is associated with abnormal auditory processing. The
Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse is a useful model for studying FXS. The KO mice show
acoustic hypersensitivity and propensity for audiogenic seizures, suggesting
altered auditory responses. However, the nature of changes at the neuronal level 
is not known. Here we conducted in vivo single unit extracellular
electrophysiology in the auditory cortex of urethane/xylazine-anesthetized Fmr1
KO mice in response to tones and frequency modulated (FM) sweeps. Using tones as 
stimuli, we report expanded frequency tuning, enhanced response magnitude, and
more variable first spike latencies in Fmr1 KO mice compared to wild-type
controls. FM sweep stimuli revealed altered sensitivity to the rate of frequency 
change indicating abnormal spectrotemporal processing. There was no difference in
FM sweep direction selectivity. Consistent with studies of the somatosensory
cortex, these data point to hyper-responsiveness of auditory neurons as a key
processing abnormality in FXS. Auditory neural responses can serve as outcome
measures in preclinical trials of therapeutics for FXS as well as serve as
physiological probes to study their mechanisms of action.

Reorganization of circuits underlying cerebellar modulation of prefrontal
cortical dopamine in mouse models of autism spectrum disorder.

Imaging, clinical, and pre-clinical studies have provided ample evidence for a
cerebellar involvement in cognitive brain function including cognitive brain
disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. We previously reported that
cerebellar activity modulates dopamine release in the mouse medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) via two distinct pathways: (1) cerebellum to mPFC via dopaminergic 
projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and (2) cerebellum to mPFC via 
glutamatergic projections from the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus (ThN md
and vl). The present study compared functional adaptations of cerebello-cortical 
circuitry following developmental cerebellar pathology in a mouse model of
developmental loss of Purkinje cells (Lurcher) and a mouse model of fragile X
syndrome (Fmr1 KO mice). Fixed potential amperometry was used to measure mPFC
dopamine release in response to cerebellar electrical stimulation. Mutant mice of
both strains showed an attenuation in cerebellar-evoked mPFC dopamine release
compared to respective wildtype mice. This was accompanied by a functional
reorganization of the VTA and thalamic pathways mediating cerebellar modulation
of mPFC dopamine release. Inactivation of the VTA pathway by intra-VTA lidocaine 
or kynurenate infusions decreased dopamine release by 50 % in wildtype and 20-30 
% in mutant mice of both strains. Intra-ThN vl infusions of either drug decreased
dopamine release by 15 % in wildtype and 40 % in mutant mice of both strains,
while dopamine release remained relatively unchanged following intra-ThN md drug 
infusions. These results indicate a shift in strength towards the thalamic vl
projection, away from the VTA. Thus, cerebellar neuropathologies associated with 
autism spectrum disorders may cause a reduction in cerebellar modulation of mPFC 
dopamine release that is related to a reorganization of the mediating neuronal
pathways.

The 3' UTR of FMR1 mRNA is a target of miR-101, miR-129-5p and miR-221:
implications for the molecular pathology of FXTAS at the synapse.

While FMR1 is silenced in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients carrying the full
mutation, its expression is elevated (2-8 fold) in premutated individuals. These 
people may develop the Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a
late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and parkinsonism.
In addition, people carrying the premutation can be affected by a set of
neurological and behavioral disorders during young age. Problems of memory have
been detected in these patients as well as in the mouse models for FXTAS. To date
little is known concerning the metabolism of FMR1 mRNA, notwithstanding the
importance of the finely tuned regulation of the expression of this gene. In the 
present study, we identified three microRNAs that specifically target the 3' UTR 
of FMR1 and can modulate its expression throughout the brain particularly at the 
synapse where their expression is very high. The expression level of miR-221 is
reduced in synaptosomal preparations of young FXTAS mice suggesting a general
deregulation of transcripts located at the synapse of these mice. By
transcriptome analysis, we show here a robust deregulation of the expression
levels of genes involved in learning, memory and autistic behavior, Parkinson
disease and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest the presence of a
synaptopathy in these animals. Interestingly, many of those deregulated mRNAs are
target of the same microRNAs that modulate the expression of FMR1 at the synapse.

MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome is an emerging neurodevelopmental disorder
associated with intellectual disability, autistic features, epilepsy, and
abnormal movements. We report 16 new patients with MEF2C haploinsufficiency,
including the oldest reported patient with MEF2C deletion at 5q14.3. We detail
the neurobehavioral phenotype, epilepsy, and abnormal movements, and compare our 
subjects with those previously reported in the literature. We also investigate
Mef2c expression in the developing mouse forebrain. A spectrum of neurofunctional
deficits emerges, with hyperkinesis a consistent finding. Epilepsy varied from
absent to severe, and included intractable myoclonic seizures and infantile
spasms. Subjects with partial MEF2C deletion were statistically less likely to
have epilepsy. Finally, we confirm that Mef2c is present both in dorsal primary
neuroblasts and ventral gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)ergic interneurons in the
forebrain of the developing mouse. Given interactions with several key
neurodevelopmental genes such as ARX, FMR1, MECP2, and TBR1, it appears that
MEF2C plays a role in several developmental stages of both dorsal and ventral
neuronal cell types.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disabilities, is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by the amplification of a
CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation gene
1 (FMR1). Prevalence estimates of the disorder are approximately 1/3600.
Psychiatric manifestations of the disorder include anxiety, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, autism, mood instability and aggression. In this article 
we review the above psychiatric manifestations and challenges to accurate
assessment. We also discuss how the neurobiological underpinnings of these
symptoms are beginning to be understood and can help guide treatment.

Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability and autism, is
thought to occur due to abnormal regulation of neuronal protein synthesis. A
study by Osterweil et al. (2013), in this issue, demonstrates that the HMG-CoA

Autism is a pervasive disorder characterized by a complex symptomatology, based
principally on social dysfunction. The disorder has a highly complex, largely
genetic etiology, involving an impressive variety of genes, the precise
contributions of which still remain to be determined. For this reason, a
reductionist approach to the study of autism has been proposed, employing
monogenic animal models of social dysfunction, either by targeting a candidate
gene, or by mimicking a single-gene disorder characterized by autistic symptoms. 
In the present review, we discuss this monogenic approach by comparing examples
of each strategy: the mu opioid receptor knock-out (KO) mouse line, which targets
the opioid system (known to be involved in the control of social behaviors); and 
the Fmr1-KO mouse, a model for Fragile X syndrome (a neurodevelopmental syndrome 
that includes autistic symptoms). The autistic-relevant behavioral phenotypes of 
the mu-opioid and Fmr1-KO mouse lines are described here, summarizing previous
work by our research group and others, but also providing novel experimental
evidence. Relevant factors influencing the validity of the two models, such as
sex differences and age at testing, are also addressed, permitting an extensive
evaluation of the advantages and limits of monogenic mouse models for autism.

Fragile X testing is a priority in the evaluation of autism spectrum disorders
(ASD) cases because identification of the FMR1 mutation leads to new treatment
options. This study is focused on determining the prevalence of the FMR1 gene
mutation among ASD cases in Indonesia. DSM-IV-TR criteria were administered to
diagnose ASD; symptom severity was classified using the Childhood Autism Rating
Scale. Cytogenetic analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and Southern blot for
FMR1 gene analysis were carried out to confirm the diagnosis of fragile X
syndrome. The fragile X site and FMR1 full mutation allele were identified in 3
out of 65 (4.6%) and 4 out of 65 (6.15%) children aged 3-17 years (57 boys and 8 
girls), respectively. The Fragile X laboratory workup is essential in the
evaluation of patients with ASD. Molecular analysis is most accurate, while
cytogenetic documentation of the fragile X site can also be useful if molecular
testing is not available.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and the leading single-gene cause of autism. It is caused by the lack 
of production of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), resulting in
cognitive deficits, hyperactivity, and autistic behaviors. Breakthrough advances 
in potential therapy for FXS followed the discovery that aberrant group 1
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling is an important constituent of 
the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Research has indicated that upon neuronal
stimulation, FMRP acts downstream of group 1 mGluRs (mGluRs1/5) to inhibit
protein synthesis, long-term depression, and
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor internalization. To
offset the deficits caused by the lack of FMRP, many pharmaceutical companies
have designed medicinal drugs to target the unrestrained stimulation of mGluR5
signaling in FXS. Indeed, promising results from animal and clinical studies
suggest that mGluR5 antagonists such as AFQ056 can successfully correct many of
the deficits in FXS. In this review, we cover the animal studies performed to
date that test the role of AFQ056 as a selective mGluR5 antagonist to alleviate
the phenotypes of FXS.

The activity-dependent transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)
induces excitatory synapse elimination in mouse neurons, which requires fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein implicated in human
cognitive dysfunction and autism. We report here that protocadherin 10 (Pcdh10), 
an autism-spectrum disorders gene, is necessary for this process. MEF2 and FMRP
cooperatively regulate the expression of Pcdh10. Upon MEF2 activation, PSD-95 is 
ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) and then
binds to Pcdh10, which links it to the proteasome for degradation. Blockade of
the Pcdh10-proteasome interaction inhibits MEF2-induced PSD-95 degradation and
synapse elimination. In FMRP-lacking neurons, elevated protein levels of
eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α (EF1α), an Mdm2-interacting protein 
and FMRP target mRNA, sequester Mdm2 and prevent MEF2-induced PSD-95
ubiquitination and synapse elimination. Together, our findings reveal roles for
multiple autism-linked genes in activity-dependent synapse elimination.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual
disability and autism. The disease is a result of lack of expression of the
fragile X mental retardation protein. Brain tissues of patients with FXS and mice
with FMRP deficiency have shown an abnormal dendritic spine phenotype. We
investigated the dendritic spine length and density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal 
neurons in 2-, 10-, and 25-week-old Fmr1 knockout (KO). Next, we studied the
effects of long-term treatment with an mGluR5 antagonist, AFQ056/Mavoglurant, on 
the spine phenotype in adult Fmr1 KO mice. We observed alterations in the spine
phenotype during development, with a decreased spine length in 2-week-old Fmr1 KO
mice compared with age-match wild-type littermates, but with increased spine
length in Fmr1 KO mice compared with 10- and 25-week-old wild-type controls. No
difference was found in spine density at any age. We report a rescue of the
abnormal spine length in adult Fmr1 KO mice after a long-term treatment with
AFQ056/Mavoglurant. This finding suggests that long-term treatment at later stage
is sufficient to reverse the structural spine abnormalities and represents a
starting point for future studies aimed at improving treatments for FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a multi-organ disease that leads to mental
retardation, macro-orchidism in males and premature ovarian insufficiency in
female carriers. FXS is also a prominent monogenic disease associated with autism
spectrum disorders (ASDs). FXS is typically caused by the loss of fragile X
mental retardation 1 (FMR1) expression, which codes for the RNA-binding protein
FMRP. Here we report the discovery of distinct RNA-recognition elements that
correspond to the two independent RNA-binding domains of FMRP, in addition to the
binding sites within the messenger RNA targets for wild-type and I304N mutant
FMRP isoforms and the FMRP paralogues FXR1P and FXR2P (also known as FXR1 and
FXR2). RNA-recognition-element frequency, ratio and distribution determine target
mRNA association with FMRP. Among highly enriched targets, we identify many genes
involved in ASD and show that FMRP affects their protein levels in human cell
culture, mouse ovaries and human brain. Notably, we discovered that these targets
are also dysregulated in Fmr1(-/-) mouse ovaries showing signs of premature
follicular overdevelopment. These results indicate that FMRP targets share
signalling pathways across different cellular contexts. As the importance of
signalling pathways in both FXS and ASD is becoming increasingly apparent, our
results provide a ranked list of genes as basis for the pursuit of new
therapeutic targets for these neurological disorders.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited intellectual
disability and is also linked to other neurologic and psychiatric disorders. FXS 
is caused by a triplet expansion that inhibits expression of the FMR1 gene; the
gene product, FMRP, regulates mRNA metabolism in the brain and thus controls the 
expression of key molecules involved in receptor signaling and spine morphology. 
While there is no definitive cure for FXS, the understanding of FMRP function has
paved the way for rational treatment designs that could potentially reverse many 
of the neurobiological changes observed in FXS. Additionally, behavioral,
pharmacological, and cognitive interventions can raise the quality of life for
both patients and their families.

OBJECTIVE: How does the behavioral expression of autism in fragile X syndrome
(FXS + Aut) compare with idiopathic autism (iAut)? Although social impairments
and restricted, repetitive behaviors are common to these variants of autism,
closer examination of these symptom domains may reveal meaningful similarities
and differences. To this end, the specific behaviors comprising the social and
repetitive behavioral domains in young children with FXS + Aut and iAut were
profiled.
METHOD: Twenty-three male subjects 3 to 5 years old with FXS + Aut were matched
by age to a group of 38 boys with iAut. Repetitive behavior was assessed using
the Repetitive Behavior Scales-Revised. Social behavior was evaluated using
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule social item severity scores.
RESULTS: Rates of stereotypy, self-injury, and sameness behaviors did not differ 
between groups, whereas compulsive and ritual behavior scores were significantly 
lower for subjects with FXS + Aut compared with those with iAut. Those with
FXS + Aut scored significantly lower (less severe) than the iAut group on five
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule measurements of social behavior: gaze
integration, quality of social overtures, social smile, facial expressions, and
response to joint attention.
CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral phenotype of FXS + Aut and iAut are most similar with
respect to lower-order (motoric) restricted, repetitive behaviors and social
approach, but differ in more complex forms of restricted, repetitive behaviors
and some social response behaviors. These findings highlight the phenotypic
heterogeneity of autism overall and its unique presentation in an etiologically
distinct condition.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inheritable mental
retardation caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene resulting in the
absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The role of this protein 
in neurons is complex and its absence gives rise to diverse alterations in
neuronal function leading to neurological disorders including mental retardation,
hyperactivity, cognitive impairment, obsessive-compulsive behaviour, seizure
activity and autism. FMRP regulates mRNA translation at dendritic spines where
synapses are formed, and thus the lack of FMRP can lead to disruptions in
synaptic transmission and plasticity. Many of these neurological deficits in FXS 
probably involve the prefrontal cortex, and in this study, we have focused on
modulatory actions of dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex. Our data indicate
that dopamine produces a long-lasting enhancement of evoked inhibitory
postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by D1-type receptors seen in wild-type
mice; however, such enhancement is absent in the Fmr1 knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice.
The facilitation of IPSCs produced by direct cAMP stimulation was unaffected in
Fmr1 KO, but D1 receptor levels were reduced in these animals. Our results show
significant disruption of dopaminergic modulation of synaptic transmission in the
Fmr1 KO mice and this alteration in inhibitory activity may provide insight into 
potential targets for the rescue of deficits associated with FXS.

Fragile X syndrome, diagnosed by Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) DNA
testing, is the most common single-gene cause of inherited intellectual
disability. The expanded CGG mutation in the FMR1 gene, once thought to have
clinical significance limited to fragile X syndrome, is now well established as
the cause for other fragile X-associated disorders including fragile X-associated
primary ovarian insufficiency and fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome in 
individuals with the premutation (carriers). The importance of early diagnostic
and management issues, in conjunction with the identification of family members
at risk for or affected by FMR1 mutations, has led to intense discussion about
the appropriate timing for early identification of FMR1 mutations. This review
includes an overview of the fragile X-associated disorders and screening efforts 
to date, and discussion of the advantages and barriers to FMR1 screening in
newborns, during childhood, and in women of reproductive age. Comparison with
screening programs for other common genetic conditions is discussed to arrive at 
action steps to increase the identification of families affected by FMR1
mutations.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of autism and
intellectual disability. Aberrant synaptic translation has been implicated in the
etiology of FXS, but most lines of research on therapeutic strategies have
targeted protein synthesis indirectly, far upstream of the translation machinery.
We sought to perturb p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a key translation
initiation and elongation regulator, in FXS model mice. We found that genetic
reduction of S6K1 prevented elevated phosphorylation of translational control
molecules, exaggerated protein synthesis, enhanced mGluR-dependent long-term
depression (LTD), weight gain, and macro-orchidism in FXS model mice. In
addition, S6K1 deletion prevented immature dendritic spine morphology and
multiple behavioral phenotypes, including social interaction deficits, impaired
novel object recognition, and behavioral inflexibility. Our results support the
model that dysregulated protein synthesis is the key causal factor in FXS and
that restoration of normal translation can stabilize peripheral and neurological 
function in FXS.

5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine
that has been suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in
neurodevelopment. While DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated
during neurodevelopment, little is known about hydroxymethylation in this
process. Here, we report DNA hydroxymethylation dynamics during cerebellum
development in the human brain. Overall, we find a positive correlation between
5-hmC levels and cerebellum development. Genome-wide profiling reveals that 5-hmC
is highly enriched on specific gene regions including exons and especially the
untranslated regions (UTRs), but it is depleted on introns and intergenic
regions. Furthermore, we have identified fetus-specific and adult-specific
differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs), most of which overlap with
genes and CpG island shores. Surprisingly, during development, DhMRs are highly
enriched in genes encoding mRNAs that can be regulated by fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP), some of which are disrupted in autism, as well as in 
many known autism genes. Our results suggest that 5-hmC-mediated epigenetic
regulation may broadly impact the development of the human brain, and its
dysregulation could contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of
neurodevelopmental disorders. Accession number: Sequencing data have been
deposited to GEO with accession number GSE40539.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of X-linked intellectual
disability (ID), associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral
impairments. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene
located on the X-chromosome. FMR1 is expected to prevent the expression of the
"fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)", which results in altered
structural and functional development of the synapse, including a loss of
synaptic plasticity. This review aims to unveil the contribution of
electrophysiological signal studies for the understanding of the information
processing impairments in FXS patients. We discuss relevant event-related
potential (ERP) studies conducted with full mutation FXS patients and clinical
populations sharing symptoms with FXS in a developmental perspective. Specific
deviances found in FXS ERP profiles are described. Alterations are reported in
N1, P2, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), N2, and P3 components in FXS compared to
healthy controls. Particularly, deviances in N1 and P2 amplitude seem to be
specific to FXS. The presented results suggest a cascade of impaired information 
processes that are in line with symptoms and anatomical findings in FXS.

Social behavior abnormalities in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are characterized by
social withdrawal, anxiety, and deficits in social cognition. To assess these
deficits, a model of FXS, the Fmr1 knockout mouse (Fmr1 KO), has been utilized.
This mouse model has a null mutation in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene
(Fmr1) and displays physical and behavioral characteristics similar to humans
with FXS. Several studies have investigated the social behavior of this model,
but the results on the behavioral phenotype have not been consistent. In order to
further characterize the social behavior in the knockout, isolation-reared Fmr1
KO were evaluated to determine if they differ in their social behavior compared
to wild-type littermate controls. Differences by genotype were not observed in
social approach behavior; however, the knockout mice showed a significantly
reduced preference for social novelty and decreased sniff time in the sociability
phase. These findings add to the growing body of knowledge on the subtle
differences in social behavior shown by the Fmr1 knockout mice, and that
differences occur when the subjects are isolation-reared. Validity of the model
and possible changes to methodology are discussed.

Fragile X syndrome, the most commonly known genetic cause of autism, is due to
loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein, which regulates signal
transduction at metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 in the brain. Fragile X mental 
retardation protein deletion in mice enhances metabotropic glutamate
receptor-5-dependent long-term depression in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Here
we show that a distinct type of metabotropic glutamate receptor-5-dependent
long-term depression at excitatory synapses of the ventral striatum and
prefrontal cortex, which is mediated by the endocannabinoid
2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol, is absent in fragile X mental retardation
protein-null mice. In these mutants, the macromolecular complex that links
metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 to the 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-producing
enzyme, diacylglycerol lipase-α (endocannabinoid signalosome), is disrupted and
metabotropic glutamate receptor-5-dependent 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol formation 
is compromised. These changes are accompanied by impaired
endocannabinoid-dependent long-term depression. Pharmacological enhancement of
2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol signalling normalizes this synaptic defect and
corrects behavioural abnormalities in fragile X mental retardation
protein-deficient mice. The results identify the endocannabinoid signalosome as a
molecular substrate for fragile X syndrome, which might be targeted by therapy.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability and autism, results from the transcriptional silencing of FMR1 and
loss of the mRNA translational repressor protein fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP). Patients with FXS exhibit changes in neuronal dendritic spine
morphology, a pathology associated with altered synaptic function. Studies in the
mouse model of fragile X have shown that loss of FMRP causes excessive synaptic
protein synthesis, which results in synaptic dysfunction and altered spine
morphology. We tested whether the pharmacologic activation of the γ-aminobutyric 
acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor could correct or reverse these phenotypes in
Fmr1-knockout mice. Basal protein synthesis, which is elevated in the hippocampus
of Fmr1-knockout mice, was corrected by the in vitro application of the selective
GABA(B) receptor agonist STX209 (arbaclofen, R-baclofen). STX209 also reduced to 
wild-type values the elevated AMPA receptor internalization in Fmr1-knockout
cultured neurons, a known functional consequence of increased protein synthesis. 
Acute administration of STX209 in vivo, at doses that modify behavior, decreased 
mRNA translation in the cortex of Fmr1-knockout mice. Finally, the chronic
administration of STX209 in juvenile mice corrected the increased spine density
in Fmr1-knockout mice without affecting spine density in wild-type mice. Thus,
activation of the GABA(B) receptor with STX209 corrected synaptic abnormalities
considered central to fragile X pathophysiology, a finding that suggests that
STX209 may be a potentially effective therapy to treat the core symptoms of FXS.

syndrome.

Impairments in the social use of language, or pragmatics, constitute a core
characteristic of autism. Problems with pragmatic language have also been
documented in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a monogenic condition that is the most
common known genetic cause of autism. Evidence suggests that social cognitive
ability, or theory of mind, may also be impaired in both conditions, and in
autism, may importantly relate to pragmatic language ability. Given the
substantial overlap observed in autism and FXS, this study aimed to better define
those social-communicative phenotypes that overlap in these two conditions by
comparing pragmatic language ability and theory of mind in children with
idiopathic autism and children with FXS, with and without autism, as well as
children with Down syndrome and typically developing controls. We further
examined correlations between these cognitive-behavioral phenotypes and molecular
genetic variation related to the Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 gene (FMR1) in
the FXS group. Results indicated that children with idiopathic autism and those
with FXS and autism performed comparably on direct-assessment measures of
pragmatic language and theory of mind, whereas those with FXS only did not differ
from controls. Theory of mind was related to pragmatic language ability in all
groups. Pragmatic language and theory of mind also correlated with genetic
variation at the FMR1 locus (Cytosine-Guanine-Guanine repeats and percent
methylation). These results point toward substantial overlap in the social and
language phenotypes in autism and FXS and suggest a molecular genetic basis to
these phenotypic profiles.

Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation carriers, who are at risk of
having children with fragile X Syndrome, were initially considered as clinically 
unaffected. However, recent clinical and molecular studies have shifted this
point of view. The incidence of premutation in the general population is
substantial. Apart from the well-documented fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia
and fragile X premature ovarian insufficiency, there is a broad constellation of 
symptoms including depression, anxiety, muscle pain, autoimmune and thyroid
disease, chronic fatigue, and fibromyalgia that has been described, particularly 
in females with the premutation (55-200 repeats). Fibromyalgia (FM) is the most
common cause of widespread pain and comprises a heterogeneous group of patients, 
affecting 2-3 % of the general population. We analyzed the FMR1 gene in a cohort 
of females diagnosed with fibromyalgia in order to assess the incidence of
premutated alleles. CGG repeat size was determined in 353 females suffering from 
FM and results were compared with a control group. Four premutated carriers in
the FM group were detected. The observed incidence is higher than that described 
for a normal female population (1/88 vs 1/250). The early detection of
premutation carriers for the FMR1 gene among individuals diagnosed with
fibromyalgia is important and would be helpful in correct genetic counseling of
patients and their families, who may be at risk of having children with fragile X
syndrome, the most common known cause of inherited intellectual disability and
autism. Our data should be cautiously interpreted based on just this study;
nevertheless, screening for the FMR1 gene in FM patients at least with
presentations suggestive of FMR1 gene-related disease seems recommendable.

BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV) at the 15q11.2 region, which includes a
gene that codes for CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1), has been
implicated in autism, intellectual disability and additional neuropsychiatric
phenotypes. In the current study we studied the function of Cyfip1 in synaptic
physiology and behavior, using mice with a disruption of the Cyfip1 gene.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We observed that in Cyfip1 heterozygous mice
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD)
induced by paired-pulse low frequency stimulation (PP-LFS) was significantly
increased in comparison to wildtype mice. In addition, mGluR-LTD was not affected
in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor in the Cyfip1 heterozygous mice,
while the same treatment inhibited LTD in wildtype littermate controls.
mGluR-agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG)-induced LTD was also
significantly increased in hippocampal slices from Cyfip1 heterozygous mice and
again showed independence from protein synthesis only in the heterozygous
animals. Furthermore, we observed that the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitor rapamycin was only effective at reducing mGluR-LTD in wildtype animals.
Behaviorally, Cyfip1 heterozygous mice showed enhanced extinction of inhibitory
avoidance. Application of both mGluR5 and mGluR1 antagonist to slices from Cyfip1
heterozygous mice reversed the increase in DHPG-induced LTD in these mice.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of
Cyfip1 mimics key aspects of the phenotype of Fmr1 knockout mice and are
consistent with the hypothesis that these effects are mediated by interaction of 
Cyfip1 and Fmrp in regulating activity-dependent translation. The data provide
support for a model where CYFIP1 haploinsufficiency in patients results in
intermediate phenotypes increasing risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.

Genomic rearrangements of chromosome 15q11-q13 are responsible for diverse
phenotypes including intellectual disabilities and autism. 15q11.2 deletion,
implicating common PWS/AS breakpoints BP1-BP2, has been described in patients
with delayed motor and speech development and behavioural problems. Here we
report the clinical and molecular characterisation of a maternally inherited
BP1-BP2 deletion in two siblings with intellectual, motor and speech delay,
autistic syndrome disorder and several dysmorphic features. One of the patients
was also a carrier of an FMR1 allele in the low premutation range. The four genes
within the deletion were under-expressed in all deletion carriers but FMR1 mRNA
levels remained normal. Our results suggest that BP1-BP2 deletion could be
considered as a risk factor for neuropsychological phenotypes and that it
presents with variable clinical expressivity.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic cause of intellectual
disability and autism. Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mice, an animal model of FXS,
exhibit spatial memory impairment and synapse malfunctioning in the hippocampus, 
with abnormal enhancement of long-term depression mediated by metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mGluR-LTD). The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) modulates 
hippocampal-dependent learning through serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) and serotonin 7
(5-HT7) receptors; the underlying mechanisms are unknown.
METHODS: We used electrophysiology to test the effects of 5-HT on mGluR-LTD in
wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice and immunocytochemistry and biotinylation assay to
study related changes of 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid
(AMPA) glutamate receptor surface expression.
RESULTS: Application of 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT (a mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT7 agonist) reversed
mGluR-LTD in hippocampal slices. Reversal of mGluR-LTD by 8-OH-DPAT persisted in 
the presence of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, was abolished by
SB-269970 (5-HT7 receptor antagonist), and was mimicked by LP-211, a novel
selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist. Consistently, 8-OH-DPAT decreased
mGluR-mediated reduction of AMPA glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) subunit surface
expression in hippocampal slices and cultured hippocampal neurons, an effect
mimicked by LP-211 and blocked by SB-269970. In Fmr1 KO mice, mGluR-LTD was
abnormally enhanced; similarly to wild-type, 8-OH-DPAT reversed mGluR-LTD and
decreased mGluR-induced reduction of surface AMPA receptors, an effect
antagonized by SB-269970.
CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin 7 receptor activation reverses metabotropic glutamate
receptor-induced AMPA receptor internalization and LTD both in wild-type and in
Fmr1 KO mice, correcting excessive mGluR-LTD. Therefore, selective activation of 
5-HT7 receptors may represent a novel strategy in the therapy of FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by
intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Expansion of a CGG
trinucleotide repeat (>200 repeats) in the 5'UTR of the fragile X mental
retardation gene, is the single most prevalent cause of cognitive disabilities.
Several screening studies for FXS, among individuals with ID from different
ethnic populations, have indicated that the prevalence of the syndrome varies
between 0.5 and 16 %. Because the high co-morbidity with autism, we have
conducted a screening study of the cohort from CHARGE, a large-scale,
population-based, case control study. We have identified six subjects carrying an
expanded allele, which emphasize the importance of screening for FXS in a
population with intellectual disabilities and ASD.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of
intellectual disability (ID), as well as the most frequent monogenic cause of
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Men with FXS exhibit ID, often associated with
autistics features, whereas women heterozygous for the full mutation are
typically less severely affected; about half have a normal or borderline
intelligence quotient (IQ). Previous findings have shown a strong association
between ID and ASD in both men and women with FXS. We describe here the case of
two sisters with ASD and FXS but without ID. One of the sisters presented with
high-functioning autism, the other one with pervasive developmental disorder not 
otherwise specified and low normal IQ.
METHODS: The methylation status of the mutated FMR1 alleles was examined by
Southern blot and methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction. The
X-chromosome inactivation was determined by analyzing the methylation status of
the androgen receptor at Xq12.
RESULTS: Both sisters carried a full mutation in the FMR1 gene, with complete
methylation and random X chromosome inactivation. We present the phenotype of the
two sisters and other family members.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that autistic behaviors and cognitive
impairment can manifest as independent traits in FXS. Mutations in FMR1, known to
cause syndromic autism, may also contribute to the etiology of high-functioning, 
non-syndromic ASD, particularly in women. Thus, screening for FXS in patients
with ASD should not be limited to those with comorbid ID.

Substantial phenotypic overlap exists between fragile X syndrome (FXS) and
autism, suggesting that FMR1 (the gene causing FXS) poses a significant risk for 
autism. Cross-population comparisons of FXS and autism therefore offer a
potentially valuable method for refining the range of phenotypes associated with 
variation in FMR1. This study adopted a broader phenotype approach, focusing on
parents who are at increased genetic liability for autism or FXS. Women who were 
carriers of FMR1 in its premutation state were compared with mothers of
individuals with autism, and controls in an attempt to determine whether subtle
features of the broad autism phenotype may express at elevated rates among FMR1
premutation carriers. The principal personality and language features comprising 
the broad autism phenotype (i.e., rigid and aloof personality, and particular
patterns of pragmatic language use) were assessed among 49 premutation carriers
who were mothers of individuals with FXS, 89 mothers of individuals with autism, 
and 23 mothers of typically developing individuals. Relative to controls, the
autism and premutation parent groups showed elevated rates of certain personality
and language characteristics of the broad autism phenotype. Findings suggest
partially overlapping personality and language profiles among autism and
premutation parent groups, with rigid personality style and patterns of pragmatic
language use emerging as features most clearly shared between groups. These
results provide further evidence for the overlap of autism and FXS, and may
implicate FMR1 in some of the subtle features comprising the broad autism
phenotype.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a leading monogenic
neurodegenerative disorder affecting premutation carriers of the fragile X (FMR1)
gene. To investigate the underlying cellular neuropathology, we produced induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from isogenic subclones of primary
fibroblasts of a female premutation carrier, with each subclone bearing
exclusively either the normal or the expanded (premutation) form of the FMR1 gene
as the active allele. We show that neurons harboring the stably-active, expanded 
allele (EX-Xa) have reduced postsynaptic density protein 95 protein expression,
reduced synaptic puncta density and reduced neurite length. Importantly, such
neurons are also functionally abnormal, with calcium transients of higher
amplitude and increased frequency than for neurons harboring the normal-active
allele. Moreover, a sustained calcium elevation was found in the EX-Xa neurons
after glutamate application. By excluding the individual genetic background
variation, we have demonstrated neuronal phenotypes directly linked to the FMR1
premutation. Our approach represents a unique isogenic, X-chromosomal epigenetic 
model to aid the development of targeted therapeutics for FXTAS, and more broadly
as a model for the study of common neurodevelopmental (e.g. autism) and
neurodegenerative (e.g. Parkinsonism, dementias) disorders.

Although the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie autism are not well understood, 
there is evidence showing that metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors
are hyper-stimulated and the GABAergic system is hypo-stimulated in autism.
Memantine is an uncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors and is widely
prescribed for treatment of Alzheimer's disease treatment. Recently, it has been 
shown to improve language function, social behavior, and self-stimulatory
behaviors of some autistic subjects. However the mechanism by which memantine
exerts its effect remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used cultured
cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) from Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model for
fragile X syndrome (FXS) and syndromic autism, to examine the effects of
memantine on dendritic spine development and synapse formation. Our results show 
that the maturation of dendritic spines is delayed in Fmr1-KO CGCs. We also
detected reduced excitatory synapse formation in Fmr1-KO CGCs. Memantine
treatment of Fmr1-KO CGCs promoted cell adhesion properties. Memantine also
stimulated the development of mushroom-shaped mature dendritic spines and
restored dendritic spine to normal levels in Fmr1-KO CGCs. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that memantine treatment promoted synapse formation and restored the
excitatory synapses to a normal range in Fmr1-KO CGCs. These findings suggest
that memantine may exert its therapeutic capacity through a stimulatory effect on
dendritic spine maturation and excitatory synapse formation, as well as promoting
adhesion of CGCs.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability 
and autism, results from loss of function of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Here, 
we show that FMRP regulates translation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1
(NOS1) in the developing human neocortex. Whereas NOS1 mRNA is widely expressed, 
NOS1 protein is transiently coexpressed with FMRP during early synaptogenesis in 
layer- and region-specific pyramidal neurons. These include midfetal layer 5
subcortically projecting neurons arranged into alternating columns in the
prospective Broca's area and orofacial motor cortex. Human NOS1 translation is
activated by FMRP via interactions with coding region binding motifs absent from 
mouse Nos1 mRNA, which is expressed in mouse pyramidal neurons, but not
efficiently translated. Correspondingly, neocortical NOS1 protein levels are
severely reduced in developing human FXS cases, but not FMRP-deficient mice.
Thus, alterations in FMRP posttranscriptional regulation of NOS1 in developing
neocortical circuits may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in FXS.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable, yet relatively few
associated genetic loci have been replicated. Copy number variations (CNVs) have 
been implicated in autism; however, the majority of loci contribute to <1% of the
disease population. Therefore, independent studies are important to refine
associated CNV regions and discover novel susceptibility genes. In this study, a 
genome-wide SNP array was utilized for CNV detection by two distinct algorithms
in a European ancestry case-control data set. We identify a significantly higher 
burden in the number and size of deletions, and disrupting more genes in ASD
cases. Moreover, 18 deletions larger than 1 Mb were detected exclusively in
cases, implicating novel regions at 2q22.1, 3p26.3, 4q12 and 14q23. Case-specific
CNVs provided further evidence for pathways previously implicated in ASDs,
revealing new candidate genes within the GABAergic signaling and neural
development pathways. These include DBI, an allosteric binder of GABA receptors, 
GABARAPL1, the GABA receptor-associated protein, and SLC6A11, a postsynaptic GABA
transporter. We also identified CNVs in COBL, deletions of which cause defects in
neuronal cytoskeleton morphogenesis in model vertebrates, and DNER, a
neuron-specific Notch ligand required for cerebellar development. Moreover, we
found evidence of genetic overlap between ASDs and other neurodevelopmental and
neuropsychiatric diseases. These genes include glutamate receptors (GRID1, GRIK2 
and GRIK4), synaptic regulators (NRXN3, SLC6A8 and SYN3), transcription factor
(ZNF804A) and RNA-binding protein FMR1. Taken together, these CNVs may be a few
of the missing pieces of ASD heritability and lead to discovering novel
etiological mechanisms.

Exome sequencing of 343 families, each with a single child on the autism spectrum
and at least one unaffected sibling, reveal de novo small indels and point
substitutions, which come mostly from the paternal line in an age-dependent
manner. We do not see significantly greater numbers of de novo missense mutations
in affected versus unaffected children, but gene-disrupting mutations (nonsense, 
splice site, and frame shifts) are twice as frequent, 59 to 28. Based on this
differential and the number of recurrent and total targets of gene disruption
found in our and similar studies, we estimate between 350 and 400 autism
susceptibility genes. Many of the disrupted genes in these studies are associated
with the fragile X protein, FMRP, reinforcing links between autism and synaptic
plasticity. We find FMRP-associated genes are under greater purifying selection
than the remainder of genes and suggest they are especially dosage-sensitive
targets of cognitive disorders.

Evidence for a fragile X mental retardation protein-mediated translational switch
in metabotropic glutamate receptor-triggered Arc translation and long-term
depression.

Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-stimulated protein synthesis and 
long-term synaptic depression (mGluR-LTD) are altered in the mouse model of
fragile X syndrome, Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice. Fmr1 encodes fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP), a dendritic RNA binding protein that functions, in
part, as a translational suppressor. It is unknown whether and how FMRP acutely
regulates LTD and/or the rapid synthesis of new proteins required for LTD, such
as the activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc). The protein
phosphatase PP2A dephosphorylates FMRP, which contributes to translational
activation of some target mRNAs. Here, we report that PP2A and dephosphorylation 
of FMRP at S500 are required for an mGluR-induced, rapid (5 min) increase in
dendritic Arc protein and LTD in rat and mouse hippocampal neurons. In Fmr1 KO
neurons, basal, dendritic Arc protein levels and mGluR-LTD are enhanced, but
mGluR-triggered Arc synthesis is absent. Lentiviral-mediated expression of
wild-type FMRP in Fmr1 KO neurons suppresses basal dendritic Arc levels and
mGluR-LTD, and restores rapid mGluR-triggered Arc synthesis. A phosphomimic of
FMRP (S500D) suppresses steady-state dendritic Arc levels but does not rescue
mGluR-induced Arc synthesis. A dephosphomimic of FMRP (S500A) neither suppresses 
dendritic Arc nor supports mGluR-induced Arc synthesis. Accordingly, S500D-FMRP
expression in Fmr1 KO neurons suppresses mGluR-LTD, whereas S500A-FMRP has no
effect. These data support a model in which phosphorylated FMRP functions to
suppress steady-state translation of Arc and LTD. Upon mGluR activation of PP2A, 
FMRP is rapidly dephosphorylated, which contributes to rapid new synthesis of Arc
and mGluR-LTD.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: FMR1-related disorders include fragile X syndrome,
fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and FMR1-related primary
ovarian insufficiency (POI). Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an
FMR1 full mutation or other loss-of-function variant and is nearly always
characterized by moderate intellectual disability in affected males and mild
intellectual disability in affected females. Because FMR1 pathogenic variants are
complex alterations involving non-classic gene-disrupting alterations
(trinucleotide repeat expansion) and abnormal gene methylation, affected
individuals occasionally have an atypical presentation with an IQ above 70, the
traditional demarcation denoting intellectual disability (previously referred to 
as mental retardation). Males with an FMR1 full mutation accompanied by aberrant 
methylation may have a characteristic appearance (large head, long face,
prominent forehead and chin, protruding ears), connective tissue findings (joint 
laxity), and large testes after puberty. Behavioral abnormalities, sometimes
including autism spectrum disorder, are common. FXTAS occurs in males (and some
females) who have an FMR1 premutation and is characterized by late-onset,
progressive cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor. FMR1-related POI (age at
cessation of menses <40 years) occurs in approximately 20% of females who have an
FMR1 premutation.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of FMR1-related disorders rests on the detection
of an alteration in FMR1. More than 99% of individuals with fragile X syndrome
have a loss-of-function variant of FMR1 caused by an increased number of CGG
trinucleotide repeats (typically >200) accompanied by aberrant methylation of
FMR1. Other pathogenic variants within FMR1 that cause fragile X syndrome include
deletions and single-nucleotide variants. All individuals with FXTAS and
FMR1-related POI have FMR1 premutation trinucleotide repeats ranging from 55 to
approximately 200. Both increased trinucleotide repeats and methylation changes
in FMR1 can be detected by molecular genetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Fragile X syndrome: early developmental 
intervention, special education (individual attention, small class size, and
avoiding sudden change and excessive stimulation), and vocational training;
individualized pharmacologic management of behavioral issues that significantly
affect social interaction; routine treatment of medical problems. FXTAS:
supportive care for gait disturbance and/or cognitive deficits. POI: reproductive
endocrine evaluation for treatment and counseling for reproductive options.
Agents/circumstances to avoid: Folic acid in individuals with poorly controlled
seizures.
GENETIC COUNSELING: All mothers of individuals with an FMR1 full mutation
(expansion >200 CGG trinucleotide repeats and abnormal methylation) are carriers 
of an FMR1 pathogenic variant. Mothers and their female relatives who are
premutation carriers are at increased risk for FXTAS and POI; those with a full
mutation may have findings of fragile X syndrome. All are at increased risk of
having offspring with fragile X syndrome, FXTAS, and POI. Males with premutations
are at increased risk for FXTAS. Males with FXTAS will transmit their FMR1
premutation expansion to none of their sons and to all of their daughters, who
will be premutation carriers. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal 
testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the diagnosis of an
FMR1-related disorder has been confirmed in a family member.

Systematic mapping of fragile X granules in the mouse brain reveals a potential
role for presynaptic FMRP in sensorimotor functions.

Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to Fragile X syndrome
(FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism.
Although the functions of FMRP and its homologs FXR1P and FXR2P are well studied 
in the somatodendritic domain, recent evidence suggests that this family of RNA
binding proteins also plays a role in the axonal and presynaptic compartments.
Fragile X granules (FXGs) are morphologically and genetically defined structures 
containing Fragile X proteins that are expressed axonally and presynaptically in 
a subset of circuits. To further understand the role of presynaptic Fragile X
proteins in the brain, we systematically mapped the FXG distribution in the mouse
central nervous system. This analysis revealed both the circuits and the neuronal
types that express FXGs. FXGs are enriched in circuits that mediate sensory
processing and motor planning-functions that are particularly perturbed in FXS
patients. Analysis of FXG expression in the hippocampus suggests that CA3
pyramidal neurons use presynaptic Fragile X proteins to modulate recurrent but
not feedforward processing. Neuron-specific FMRP mutants revealed a requirement
for neuronal FMRP in the regulation of FXGs. Finally, conditional FMRP ablation
demonstrated that FXGs are expressed in axons of thalamic relay nuclei that
innervate cortex, but not in axons of thalamic reticular nuclei, striatal nuclei,
or cortical neurons that innervate thalamus. Together, these findings support the
proposal that dysregulation of axonal and presynaptic Fragile X proteins
contribute to the neurological symptoms of FXS.

Fragile X syndrome: mechanistic insights and therapeutic avenues regarding the
role of potassium channels.

Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94158, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of mental disability and one of the
known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of 
the trinucleotide CGG repeats that leads to DNA methylation of the fragile X
mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1) and transcriptional silencing, resulting in the 
absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA binding protein. 
Although it is widely known that FMRP is critical for metabotropic glutamate
receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD), which has provided a
general theme for developing pharmacological drugs for FXS, specific downstream
targets of FMRP may also be of therapeutic value. Since alterations in potassium 
channel expression level or activity could underlie neuronal network defects in
FXS, here we describe recent findings on how these channels might be altered in
mouse models of FXS and the possible therapeutic avenues for treating FXS.

Fragile X is the most common known inherited cause of intellectual disability and
autism, and it typically results from transcriptional silencing of FMR1 and loss 
of the encoded protein, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein). FMRP is an
mRNA-binding protein that functions at many synapses to inhibit local translation
stimulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 1 and 5. Recent studies
on the biology of FMRP and the signaling pathways downstream of mGluR1/5 have
yielded deeper insight into how synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity are
regulated by experience. This new knowledge has also suggested ways that altered 
signaling and synaptic function can be corrected in fragile X, and human clinical
trials based on this information are under way.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of inherited intellectual disability
and a well-characterized form of autism spectrum disorder. As brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in the pathophysiology of FXS we
examined the effects of reduced BDNF expression on the behavioral phenotype of an
animal model of FXS, Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, crossed with mice carrying a
deletion of one copy of the Bdnf gene (Bdnf(+/-)). Fmr1 KO mice showed
age-dependent alterations in hippocampal BDNF expression that declined after the 
age of 4 months compared to wild-type controls. Mild deficits in water maze
learning in Bdnf(+/-) and Fmr1 KO mice were exaggerated and contextual fear
learning significantly impaired in double transgenics. Reduced BDNF expression
did not alter basal nociceptive responses or central hypersensitivity in Fmr1 KO 
mice. Paradoxically, the locomotor hyperactivity and deficits in sensorimotor
learning and startle responses characteristic of Fmr1 KO mice were ameliorated by
reducing BNDF, suggesting changes in simultaneously and in parallel working
hippocampus-dependent and striatum-dependent systems. Furthermore, the obesity
normally seen in Bdnf(+/-) mice was eliminated by the absence of fragile X mental
retardation protein 1 (FMRP). Reduced BDNF decreased the survival of newborn
cells in the ventral part of the hippocampus both in the presence and absence of 
FMRP. Since a short neurite phenotype characteristic of newborn cells lacking
FMRP was not found in cells derived from double mutant mice, changes in neuronal 
maturation likely contributed to the behavioral phenotype. Our results show that 
the absence of FMRP modifies the diverse effects of BDNF on the FXS phenotype.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability and prevailing known genetic basis of autism, is caused by an
expansion in the Fmr1 gene that prevents transcription and translation of fragile
X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP binds to and controls translation of
mRNAs downstream of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation. Recent
work shows that FMRP interacts with the transcript encoding striatal-enriched
protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP; Ptpn5). STEP opposes synaptic strengthening
and promotes synaptic weakening by dephosphorylating its substrates, including
ERK1/2, p38, Fyn and Pyk2, and subunits of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA
receptors. Here, we show that basal levels of STEP are elevated and
mGluR-dependent STEP synthesis is absent in Fmr1(KO) mice. We hypothesized that
the weakened synaptic strength and behavioral abnormalities reported in FXS may
be linked to excess levels of STEP. To test this hypothesis, we reduced or
eliminated STEP genetically in Fmr1(KO) mice and assessed mice in a battery of
behavioral tests. In addition to attenuating audiogenic seizures and
seizure-induced c-Fos activation in the periaqueductal gray, genetically reducing
STEP in Fmr1(KO) mice reversed characteristic social abnormalities, including
approach, investigation and anxiety. Loss of STEP also corrected select nonsocial
anxiety-related behaviors in Fmr1(KO) mice, such as light-side exploration in the
light/dark box. Our findings indicate that genetically reducing STEP
significantly diminishes seizures and restores select social and nonsocial
anxiety-related behaviors in Fmr1(KO) mice, suggesting that strategies to inhibit
STEP activity may be effective for treating patients with FXS.

Glutamate induces the elongation of early dendritic protrusions via mGluRs in
wild type mice, but not in fragile X mice.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited from of autism and mental
impairment, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene, resulting in
the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal 
neurons in affected individuals are abnormally immature and in Fmr1 knockout (KO)
mice they are also abnormally unstable. This could result in defects in
synaptogenesis, because spine dynamics are critical for synapse formation. We
have previously shown that the earliest dendritic protrusions, which are highly
dynamic and might serve an exploratory role to reach out for axons, elongate in
response to glutamate. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this process is
mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and that it is defective in
Fmr1 KO mice. Using time-lapse imaging with two-photon microscopy in acute brain 
slices from early postnatal mice, we find that early dendritic protrusions in
layer 2/3 neurons become longer in response to application of glutamate or DHPG, 
a Group 1 mGluR agonist. Blockade of mGluR5 signaling, which reverses some adult 
phenotypes of KO mice, prevented the glutamate-mediated elongation of early
protrusions. In contrast, dendritic protrusions from KO mice failed to respond to
glutamate. Thus, absence of FMRP may impair the ability of cortical pyramidal
neurons to respond to glutamate released from nearby pre-synaptic terminals,
which may be a critical step to initiate synaptogenesis and stabilize spines.

Evidence suggests a strong genetic basis to autism. Our research program focuses 
on identifying genetically meaningful phenotypes in autism, through
family-genetic and cross-population methods, with a particular focus on language 
and social phenotypes that have been shown to aggregate in families of
individuals with autism. In this article, we discuss recent findings from family 
study research implicating particular language and personality features as
markers for genetic liability to autism and fragile X syndrome and FMR1-related
variation in relatives. We conclude with consideration of the clinical
implications of such findings.

The Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited mental
retardation and also considered a monogenic cause of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
FXS symptoms include neurodevelopmental delay, anxiety, hyperactivity, and
autistic-like behavior. The disease is due to mutations or loss of the Fragile X 
Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein abundant in the brain
and gonads, the two organs mainly affected in FXS patients. FMRP has multiple
functions in RNA metabolism, including mRNA decay, dendritic targeting of mRNAs, 
and protein synthesis. In neurons lacking FMRP, a wide array of mRNAs encoding
proteins involved in synaptic structure and function are altered. As a result of 
this complex dysregulation, in the absence of FMRP, spine morphology and
functioning is impaired. Consistently, model organisms for the study of the
syndrome recapitulate the phenotype observed in FXS patients, such as dendritic
spine anomalies and defects in learning. Here, we review the fundamentals of
genetic and clinical aspects of FXS, devoting a specific attention to ASD
comorbidity and FXS-related diseases. We also review the current knowledge on
FMRP functions through structural, molecular, and cellular findings. Finally, we 
discuss the neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral defects caused 
by FMRP loss, as well as the current treatments able to partially revert some of 
the FXS abnormalities.

BACKGROUND: There is interest in defining mouse neurobiological phenotypes useful
for studying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in both forward and reverse genetic 
approaches. A recurrent focus has been on high-order behavioral analyses,
including learning and memory paradigms and social paradigms. However,
well-studied mouse models, including for example Fmr1 knockout mice, do not show 
dramatic deficits in such high-order phenotypes, raising a question as to what
constitutes useful phenotypes in ASD models.
METHODS: To address this, we made use of a list of 112 disease genes
etiologically involved in ASD to survey, on a large scale and with unbiased
methods as well as expert review, phenotypes associated with a targeted
disruption of these genes in mice, using the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology
database. In addition, we compared the results with similar analyses for human
phenotypes.
FINDINGS: We observed four classes of neurobiological phenotypes associated with 
disruption of a large proportion of ASD genes, including: (1) Changes in brain
and neuronal morphology; (2) electrophysiological changes; (3) neurological
changes; and (4) higher-order behavioral changes. Alterations in brain and
neuronal morphology represent quantitative measures that can be more widely
adopted in models of ASD to understand cellular and network changes.
Interestingly, the electrophysiological changes differed across different genes, 
indicating that excitation/inhibition imbalance hypotheses for ASD would either
have to be so non-specific as to be not falsifiable, or, if specific, would not
be supported by the data. Finally, it was significant that in analyses of both
mouse and human databases, many of the behavioral alterations were neurological
changes, encompassing sensory alterations, motor abnormalities, and seizures, as 
opposed to higher-order behavioral changes in learning and memory and social
behavior paradigms.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that mutations in ASD genes result in defined 
groups of changes in mouse models and support a broad neurobiological approach to
phenotyping rodent models for ASD, with a focus on biochemistry and molecular
biology, brain and neuronal morphology, and electrophysiology, as well as both
neurological and additional behavioral analyses. Analysis of human phenotypes
associated with these genes reinforced these conclusions, supporting face
validity for these approaches to phenotyping of ASD models. Such phenotyping is
consistent with the successes in Fmr1 knockout mice, in which morphological
changes recapitulated human findings and electrophysiological deficits resulted
in molecular insights that have since led to clinical trials. We propose both
broad domains and, based on expert review of more than 50 publications in each of
the four neurobiological domains, specific tests to be applied to rodent models
of ASD.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability and results from the loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein 
(FMRP). Many fragile X-related cognitive and behavioral features emerge during
childhood and are associated with abnormal synaptic and cellular organization of 
the cerebral cortex. Identifying the roles of FMRP in cortical development will
provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of the syndrome. However, how 
the loss of FMRP influences the developmental trajectory of cortical maturation
remains unclear. We took advantage of the stereotyped and well-characterized
development of the murine primary somatosensory cortex to examine cortical
maturation during a time-window that corresponds to late embryonic and early
postnatal development in the human. In the Fmr1 knockout mouse, we find a delay
in somatosensory map formation, alterations in the morphology profile of
dendrites and spines of layer 4 neurons and a decrease in the synaptic levels of 
proteins involved in glutamate receptor signaling at times corresponding to the
highest levels of FMRP expression. In contrast, cortical arealization, synaptic
density in layer 4 and early postnatal regulation of mRNAs encoding synaptic
proteins are not altered in Fmr1 knockout mice. The specificity of the
developmental delay in Fmr1 knockout mice indicates that the loss of FMRP does
not result in a general stalling of cerebral cortex maturation. Instead, our
results suggest that inaccurate timing of developmental processes caused by the
loss of FMRP may lead to alterations in neural circuitry that underlie behavioral
and cognitive dysfunctions associated with FXS.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of diseases exhibiting impairment in
social drive, communication/language skills and stereotyped behaviors. Though an 
increased number of candidate genes and molecular interactions have been
identified by various approaches, the pathogenesis remains elusive. Based on
clinical observations, data from accessible GWAS and expression datasets we
identified ASDs gene candidates. Integrative gene network and a novel CNV-centric
Node Network (CNN) analysis method highlighted ASDs-associated key elements and
biological processes. Functional analysis identified neurological functions
including synaptic cholinergic receptor (CHRNA) families, dopamine receptor
(DRD2), and correlations between social behavior and oxytocin related pathways.
CNN analysis of genome-wide genetic and expression data identified
inheritance-related clusters related to PTEN/TSC1/FMR1 and mTor/PI3K regulation. 
Integrative analysis identified potential regulators of networks, specifically
TNF and beta-estradiol, suggesting a potential central role in ASDs. Our data
provide information on potential disease mechanisms, and key regulators that may 
generate novel postulations, and diagnostic molecular biomarkers.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and autism. The protein (FMRP) encoded by the fragile X mental
retardation gene (FMR1), is an RNA-binding protein linked to translational
control. Recently, in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of FXS, dysregulated
translation initiation signaling was observed. To investigate whether an altered 
signaling was also a feature of subjects with FXS compared to typical developing 
controls, we isolated total RNA and translational control proteins from
lymphocytes of subjects from both groups (38 FXS and 14 TD). Although we did not 
observe any difference in the expression level of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for
translational initiation control proteins isolated from participant with FXS, we 
found increased phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
substrate, p70 ribosomal subunit 6 kinase1 (S6K1) and of the mTOR regulator, the 
serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt), in their protein lysates. In addition, we 
observed increased phosphorylation of the cap binding protein eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) suggesting that protein synthesis is upregulated in 
FXS. Similar to the findings in lymphocytes, we observed increased
phosphorylation of S6K1 in brain tissue from patients with FXS (n = 4) compared
to normal age-matched controls (n = 4). Finally, we detected increased expression
of the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2), a known FMRP interactor. 
This data verify and extend previous findings using lymphocytes for studies of
neuropsychiatric disorders and provide evidence that misregulation of mTOR
signaling observed in the FXS mouse model also occurs in human FXS and may
provide useful biomarkers for designing targeted treatments in FXS.

Enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor subunit 5 (mGluR5) function is causally 
associated with the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, a leading inherited
cause of intellectual disability and autism. Here we provide evidence that
altered mGluR5-Homer scaffolds contribute to mGluR5 dysfunction and phenotypes in
the fragile X syndrome mouse model, Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1(-/y)). In Fmr1(-/y) mice,
mGluR5 was less associated with long Homer isoforms but more associated with the 
short Homer1a. Genetic deletion of Homer1a restored mGluR5-long Homer scaffolds
and corrected several phenotypes in Fmr1(-/y) mice, including altered mGluR5
signaling, neocortical circuit dysfunction and behavior. Acute, peptide-mediated 
disruption of mGluR5-Homer scaffolds in wild-type mice mimicked many Fmr1(-/y)
phenotypes. In contrast, Homer1a deletion did not rescue altered mGluR-dependent 
long-term synaptic depression or translational control of target mRNAs of fragile
X mental retardation protein, the gene product of Fmr1. Our findings reveal new
functions for mGluR5-Homer interactions in the brain and delineate distinct
mechanisms of mGluR5 dysfunction in a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction and
autism.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability, with behaviors characteristic of autism. Symptoms include abnormal
social behavior, repetitive behavior, communication disorders, and seizures. Many
symptoms of FXS have been replicated in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. Whether Fmr1
KO mice exhibit vocal communication deficits is not known. By recording
ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) produced by adult male mice during mating, we show
that USV calling rate (number of calls/second) is reduced in Fmr1 KO mice
compared to WT controls. The WT control and Fmr1 KO groups did not differ in
other aspects of mating behavior such as time spent sniffing, mounting, rooting
and without contact. Acoustic properties of calls such as mean frequency (in
kHz), duration and dynamic range of frequencies were not different. This
indicates a specific deficit in USV calling rate in Fmr1 KO mice. Previous
studies have shown that treatment of Fmr1 KO mice with minocycline for 4weeks
from birth can alleviate some behavioral symptoms. Here we tested if minocycline 
also reversed vocalization deficits in these mice. Calling rate increased and was
similar to WT controls in adult Fmr1 KO mice treated with minocycline for four
weeks from birth (P0-P28). All acoustic properties measured were similar in
treated and untreated WT control mice indicating minocycline effects were
specific to vocalizations in the Fmr1 KO mice. These data suggest that
mating-related USVs are robust and relevant biomarkers of FXS, and that
minocycline treatment is a promising avenue for treatment of FXS symptoms.

of fragile X syndrome.

Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited form of cognitive
disability, have a wide range of symptoms including hyperactivity, autistic
behavior, seizures and learning deficits. FXS is caused by silencing of FMR1 and 
the consequent absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an
RNA-binding protein that associates with polyribosomes and negatively regulates
translation. In a previous study of a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 knockout (KO)) we 
demonstrated that in vivo rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) were
elevated in selective brain regions suggesting that the absence of FMRP in FXS
may result in dysregulation of cerebral protein synthesis. Lithium, a drug used
clinically to treat bipolar disorder, has been used to improve mood dysregulation
in individuals with FXS. We reported previously that in the Fmr1 KO mouse chronic
dietary lithium treatment reversed or ameliorated both behavioral and
morphological abnormalities. Herein we report that chronic dietary lithium
treatment reversed the increased rCPS in Fmr1 KO mice with little effect on wild 
type mice. We also report our results of analyses of key signaling molecules
involved in regulation of mRNA translation. Our analyses indicate that neither
effects on the PI3K/Akt nor the MAPK/ERK 1/2 pathway fully account for the
effects of lithium treatment on rCPS. Collectively our findings and those from
other laboratories on the efficacy of lithium treatment in animal models support 
further studies in patients with FXS.

AIMS: Most individuals with intellectual disability and/or autism are tested for 
Fragile X syndrome at some point in their lifetime. Greater than 99% of
individuals with Fragile X have an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat motif in the
promoter region of the FMR1 gene, and diagnostic testing involves determining the
size of the CGG repeat as well as methylation status when an expansion is
present.
RESULTS: Using a previously described triplet repeat-primed polymerase chain
reaction, we have performed additional validation studies using two cohorts with 
previous diagnostic testing results available for comparison purposes. The first 
cohort (n=88) consisted of both males and females and had a high percentage of
abnormal samples, while the second cohort (n=624) consisted of only females and
was not enriched for expansion mutations. Data from each cohort were completely
concordant with the results previously obtained during the course of diagnostic
testing.
CONCLUSIONS: This study further demonstrates the utility of using
laboratory-developed triplet repeat-primed FMR1 testing in a clinical setting.

Tuberous sclerosis complex and fragile X syndrome are genetic diseases
characterized by intellectual disability and autism. Because both syndromes are
caused by mutations in genes that regulate protein synthesis in neurons, it has
been hypothesized that excessive protein synthesis is one core pathophysiological
mechanism of intellectual disability and autism. Using electrophysiological and
biochemical assays of neuronal protein synthesis in the hippocampus of Tsc2(+/-) 
and Fmr1(-/y) mice, here we show that synaptic dysfunction caused by these
mutations actually falls at opposite ends of a physiological spectrum. Synaptic, 
biochemical and cognitive defects in these mutants are corrected by treatments
that modulate metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in opposite directions, and
deficits in the mutants disappear when the mice are bred to carry both mutations.
Thus, normal synaptic plasticity and cognition occur within an optimal range of
metabotropic glutamate-receptor-mediated protein synthesis, and deviations in
either direction can lead to shared behavioural impairments.

Elevated levels of the vesicular monoamine transporter and a novel repetitive
behavior in the Drosophila model of fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is characterized by mental impairment and autism in
humans, and it often features hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors. The
mechanisms for the disease, however, remain poorly understood. Here we report
that the dfmr1 mutant in the Drosophila model of FXS grooms excessively, which
may be regulated differentially by two signaling pathways. Blocking metabotropic 
glutamate receptor signaling enhances grooming in dfmr1 mutant flies, whereas
blocking the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) suppresses excessive
grooming. dfmr1 mutant flies also exhibit elevated levels of VMAT mRNA and
protein. These results suggest that enhanced monoamine signaling correlates with 
repetitive behaviors and hyperactivity associated with FXS.

regulated by phosphorylation.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1
(FMR1) gene product (FMRP), is the most common heritable cause of intellectual
disability and autism spectrum disorders. It has been long hypothesized that the 
phosphorylation of serine 500 (S500) in human FMRP controls its function as an
RNA-binding translational repressor. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we employed
neuronally targeted expression of three human FMR1 transgenes, including
wild-type (hFMR1), dephosphomimetic (S500A-hFMR1) and phosphomimetic
(S500D-hFMR1), in the Drosophila FXS disease model to investigate phosphorylation
requirements. At the molecular level, dfmr1 null mutants exhibit elevated brain
protein levels due to loss of translational repressor activity. This defect is
rescued for an individual target protein and across the population of brain
proteins by the phosphomimetic, whereas the dephosphomimetic phenocopies the null
condition. At the cellular level, dfmr1 null synapse architecture exhibits
increased area, branching and bouton number. The phosphomimetic fully rescues
these synaptogenesis defects, whereas the dephosphomimetic provides no rescue.
The presence of Futsch-positive (microtubule-associated protein 1B) supernumerary
microtubule loops is elevated in dfmr1 null synapses. The human phosphomimetic
restores normal Futsch loops, whereas the dephosphomimetic provides no activity. 
At the behavioral level, dfmr1 null mutants exhibit strongly impaired olfactory
associative learning. The human phosphomimetic targeted only to the
brain-learning center restores normal learning ability, whereas the
dephosphomimetic provides absolutely no rescue. We conclude that human FMRP S500 
phosphorylation is necessary for its in vivo function as a neuronal translational
repressor and regulator of synaptic architecture, and for the manifestation of
FMRP-dependent learning behavior.

The GABA(A) receptor agonist THIP ameliorates specific behavioral deficits in the
mouse model of fragile X syndrome.

Hyperactivity, hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli, and exaggerated fear are
common behavioral abnormalities observed in individuals with fragile X syndrome
(FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder that is the most common genetic cause of
autism. Evidence from studies of the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS
supports the notion that impaired GABAergic transmission in different brain
regions such as the amygdala, striatum or cerebral cortex is central to FXS
behavioral abnormalities. This suggests that the GABAergic system might be an
intriguing target to ameliorate some of the phenotypes in FXS. Our recent work
revealed that THIP (gaboxadol), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, can restore principal
neuron excitability deficits in the Fmr1 KO amygdala, suggesting that THIP may
also restore some of the key behavioral abnormalities in Fmr1 KO mice. Here, we
reveal that THIP significantly attenuated hyperactivity in Fmr1 KO mice, and
reduced prepulse inhibition in a volume-dependent manner. In contrast, THIP did
not reverse the deficits in cued fear or startle response. Thus, this study shows
that enhancing GABAergic transmission can correct specific behavioral phenotypes 
of the Fmr1 KO mouse further supporting that targeting the GABAergic system, and 
specifically tonic inhibition, might be important for correcting or ameliorating 
some key behaviors in FXS.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability and the leading known genetic cause of autism. Fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent or expressed at substantially reduced
levels in FXS, binds to and controls the postsynaptic translation of amyloid
β-protein precursor (AβPP) mRNA. Cleavage of AβPP can produce β-amyloid (Aβ), a
39-43 amino acid peptide mis-expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down
syndrome (DS). Aβ is over-expressed in the brain of Fmr1(KO) mice, suggesting a
pathogenic role in FXS. To determine if genetic reduction of AβPP/Aβ rescues
characteristic FXS phenotypes, we assessed audiogenic seizures (AGS), anxiety,
the ratio of mature versus immature dendritic spines and metabotropic glutamate
receptor (mGluR)-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in Fmr1(KO) mice after
removal of one App allele. All of these phenotypes were partially or completely
reverted to normal. Plasma Aβ(1-42) was significantly reduced in full-mutation
FXS males compared to age-matched controls while cortical and hippocampal levels 
were somewhat increased, suggesting that Aβ is sequestered in the brain. Evolving
therapies directed at reducing Aβ in AD may be applicable to FXS and Aβ may serve
as a plasma-based biomarker to facilitate disease diagnosis or assess therapeutic
efficacy.

Fragile x syndrome.

Recent data from a national survey highlighted a significant difference in
obesity rates in young fragile X males (31%) compared to age matched controls
(18%). Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of intellectual
disability in males and the most common single gene cause of autism. This
X-linked disorder is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide CGG repeat (>200) 
on the promotor region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). As a
result, the promotor region often becomes methylated which leads to a deficiency 
or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). Common characteristics of FXS include mild
to severe cognitive impairments in males but less severe cognitive impairment in 
females. Physical features of FXS include an elongated face, prominent ears, and 
post-pubertal macroorchidism. Severe obesity in full mutation males is often
associated with the Prader-Willi phenotype (PWP) which includes hyperphagia, lack
of satiation after meals, and hypogonadism or delayed puberty; however, there is 
no deletion at 15q11-q13 nor uniparental maternal disomy. Herein, we discuss the 
molecular mechanisms leading to FXS and the Prader-Willi phenotype with an
emphasis on mouse FMR1 knockout studies that have shown the reversal of weight
increase through mGluR antagonists. Finally, we review the current medications
used in treatment of FXS including the atypical antipsychotics that can lead to
weight gain and the research regarding the use of targeted treatments in FXS that
will hopefully have a significantly beneficial effect on cognition and behavior
without weight gain.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability. In addition to cognitive deficits, FXS patients exhibit
hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties, anxiety, and other
autistic-like behaviors. FXS is caused by an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat in
the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) gene
leading to epigenetic silencing and loss of expression of the Fragile X Mental
Retardation protein (FMRP). Despite the known relationship between FMR1 CGG
repeat expansion and FMR1 silencing, the epigenetic modifications observed at the
FMR1 locus, and the consequences of the loss of FMRP on human neurodevelopment
and neuronal function remain poorly understood. To address these limitations, we 
report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from
multiple patients with FXS and the characterization of their differentiation into
post-mitotic neurons and glia. We show that clones from reprogrammed FXS patient 
fibroblast lines exhibit variation with respect to the predominant CGG-repeat
length in the FMR1 gene. In two cases, iPSC clones contained predominant
CGG-repeat lengths shorter than measured in corresponding input population of
fibroblasts. In another instance, reprogramming a mosaic patient having both
normal and pre-mutation length CGG repeats resulted in genetically matched iPSC
clonal lines differing in FMR1 promoter CpG methylation and FMRP expression.
Using this panel of patient-specific, FXS iPSC models, we demonstrate aberrant
neuronal differentiation from FXS iPSCs that is directly correlated with
epigenetic modification of the FMR1 gene and a loss of FMRP expression. Overall, 
these findings provide evidence for a key role for FMRP early in human
neurodevelopment prior to synaptogenesis and have implications for modeling of
FXS using iPSC technology. By revealing disease-associated cellular phenotypes in
human neurons, these iPSC models will aid in the discovery of novel therapeutics 
for FXS and other autism-spectrum disorders sharing common pathophysiology.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of inherited intellectual disability
and is one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for
FXS is a large expansion of the trinucleotide CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated
region of the X-linked gene FMR1. This expansion leads to DNA methylation of FMR1
and to transcriptional silencing, which results in the absence of the gene
product, FMRP, a selective messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein that regulates
the translation of a subset of dendritic mRNAs. FMRP is critical for mGluR
(metabotropic glutamate receptor)-dependent long-term depression, as well as for 
other forms of synaptic plasticity; its absence causes excessive and persistent
protein synthesis in postsynaptic dendrites and dysregulated synaptic function.
Studies continue to refine our understanding of FMRP's role in synaptic
plasticity and to uncover new functions of this protein, which have illuminated
therapeutic approaches for FXS.

This chapter will briefly tie together a captivating string of scientific
discoveries that began in the 1800s and catapulted us into the current state of
the field where trials are under way in humans that have arisen directly from the
discoveries made in model organisms such as Drosophila (fruit flies) and mice.
The hope is that research efforts in the field of fragile X currently represent a
roadmap that demonstrates the utility of identifying a mutant gene responsible
for human disease, tracking down the molecular underpinnings of pathogenic
phenotypes, and utilizing model organisms to identify and validate potential
pharmacologic targets for testing in afflicted humans. Indeed, in fragile X this 
roadmap has already yielded successful trials in humans (J. Med. Genetic 46(4)
266-271; Jacquemont et al. Sci Transl Med 3(64):64ra61), although the work in
studying these interventions in humans is just getting underway as the work in
model organisms continues to generate new potential therapeutic targets.

Seizures are a common co-occurring condition in those with fragile X syndrome
(FXS), and in those with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Seizures are 
also associated with ASD in those with FXS. However, little is known about the
rate of seizures and how commonly these problems co-occur with ASD in boys with
the FMR1 premutation. We, therefore, determined the prevalence of seizures and
ASD in boys with the FMR1 premutation compared with their sibling counterparts
and population prevalence estimates. Fifty premutation boys who presented as
clinical probands (N = 25), or non-probands (identified by cascade testing after 
the proband was found) (N = 25), and 32 non-carrier controls were enrolled.
History of seizures was documented and ASD was diagnosed by standardized measures
followed by a team consensus of ASD diagnosis. Seizures (28%) and ASD (68%) were 
more prevalent in probands compared with non-probands (0 and 28%), controls (0
and 0%), and population estimates (1 and 1.7%). Seizures occurred more frequently
in those with the premutation and co-morbid ASD particularly in probands compared
with those with the premutation alone (25 vs. 3.85%, p = 0.045). Although
cognitive and adaptive functioning in non-probands were similar to controls,
non-probands were more likely to meet the diagnosis of ASD than controls (28 vs. 
0%, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, seizures were relatively more common in
premutation carriers who presented clinically as probands of the family and
seizures were commonly associated with ASD in these boys. Therefore, boys with
the premutation, particularly if they are probands should be assessed carefully
for both ASD and seizures.

The prevalence of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is 1 in 4000 in males and 1 in 2500 in
males and females, respectively, in the general population. Several screening
studies aimed at determining the prevalence of FXS have been conducted in
individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) with a prevalence varying from
1.15% to 6.3% across different ethnic groups. A previous study in Indonesia
showed an FXS prevalence of 1.9% among the ID population. A rapid, effective, and
inexpensive method for FMR1 screening, using dried blood spots capable of
detecting an expanded FMR1 allele in both males and females, was recently
reported. We used this approach to screen 176 blood spots, collected from Central
Java, Indonesia, for the presence of expanded FMR1 gene alleles. Samples were
collected from high-risk populations: 112 individuals with ID, 32 obtained from
individuals with diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, and 32 individuals with 
a known family history of FXS. Fourteen subjects carrying an FMR1 expanded allele
were identified including 7 premutations (55-200 CGG repeats) and 7 full
mutations (>200 repeats). Of the seven subjects identified with a full mutation, 
one subject was from a non-fragile X family, and six from were families with a
history of FXS.

Despite the pronounced neurological deficits associated with mental retardation
and autism, the degree to which neocortical circuit function is altered remains
unknown. Here, we study changes in neocortical network function in the form of
persistent activity states in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome--the Fmr1
knock-out (KO). Persistent activity states, or UP states, in the neocortex
underlie the slow oscillation which occurs predominantly during slow-wave sleep, 
but may also play a role during awake states. We show that spontaneously
occurring UP states in the primary somatosensory cortex are 38-67% longer in Fmr1
KO slices. In vivo, UP states reoccur with a clear rhythmic component consistent 
with that of the slow oscillation and are similarly longer in the Fmr1 KO.
Changes in neocortical excitatory circuitry likely play the major role in this
alteration as supported by three findings: (1) longer UP states occur in slices
of isolated neocortex, (2) pharmacologically isolated excitatory circuits in Fmr1
KO neocortical slices display prolonged bursting states, and (3) selective
deletion of Fmr1 in cortical excitatory neurons is sufficient to cause prolonged 
UP states whereas deletion in inhibitory neurons has no effect. Excess signaling 
mediated by the group 1 glutamate metabotropic receptor, mGluR5, contributes to
the longer UP states. Genetic reduction or pharmacological blockade of mGluR5
rescues the prolonged UP state phenotype. Our results reveal an alteration in
network function in a mouse model of intellectual disability and autism which may
impact both slow-wave sleep and information processing during waking states.

Animal studies elucidating the neurobiology of fragile X syndrome (FXS) have led 
to multiple controlled trials in humans, with the Aberrant Behavior
Checklist-Community (ABC-C) commonly adopted as a primary outcome measure. A
multi-site collaboration examined the psychometric properties of the ABC-C in 630
individuals (ages 3-25) with FXS using exploratory and confirmatory factor
analysis. Results support a six-factor structure, with one factor unchanged
(Inappropriate Speech), four modified (Irritability, Hyperactivity,
Lethargy/Withdrawal, and Stereotypy), and a new Social Avoidance factor. A
comparison with ABC-C data from individuals with general intellectual disability 
and a list of commonly endorsed items are also reported. Reformulated ABC-C
scores based on this FXS-specific factor structure may provide added outcome
measure specificity and sensitivity in FXS clinical trials.

Fragile X syndrome: the GABAergic system and circuit dysfunction.

Washington, DC 20010, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
intellectual disability, sensory hypersensitivity, and high incidences of autism 
spectrum disorders and epilepsy. These phenotypes are suggestive of defects in
neural circuit development and imbalances in excitatory glutamatergic and
inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. While alterations in excitatory synapse
function and plasticity are well-established in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse models
of FXS, a number of recent electrophysiological and molecular studies now
identify prominent defects in inhibitory GABAergic transmission in behaviorally
relevant forebrain regions such as the amygdala, cortex, and hippocampus. In this
review, we summarize evidence for GABAergic system dysfunction in FXS patients
and Fmr1 KO mouse models alike. We then discuss some of the known developmental
roles of GABAergic signaling, as well as the development and refinement of
GABAergic synapses as a framework for understanding potential causes of mature
circuit dysfunction. Finally, we highlight the GABAergic system as a relevant
target for the treatment of FXS.

OBJECTIVE: FM is a disorder of altered pain regulation and is characterized by
pain, fatigue, poor sleep and psychological impairments; thus, it is classified
as a central sensitivity syndrome. Female carriers of a premutation in the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene frequently have widespread
musculoskeletal pain and sometimes have been diagnosed with FM, especially if
they have the motor signs of fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
Studies suggest that FM occurs in persons with a genetic predisposition. We
describe the clinical features of female FMR1 premutation carriers with symptoms 
of FM.
METHODS: A sample of patients was selected that participated in studies at two
tertiary referral academic centres on the phenotype and therapy of FXTAS.
RESULTS: This selected sample of patients, five female premutation carriers, has 
FM symptoms or diagnoses and other central sensitivity syndromes.
CONCLUSION: Since FM affects 2-4% of the world's population and about 1 in 250
females are FMR1 carriers, a study screening females with FM for the presence of 
the FMR1 premutation is worthwhile. A finding of increased prevalence of FMR1
carriers among females with FM would impact the standard evaluation of FM.
Presently, guidelines for FMR1 genetic testing includes early menopause,
congenital intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, tremor or ataxia,
and a family history of FXTAS or fragile X syndrome. The latter is a common cause
of autism and developmental delay. Such testing is important because female
carriers are at risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome.

Recent work has demonstrated the impact of dysfunction of the GABAergic signaling
system in brain and the resultant behavioral pathologies in subjects with autism.
In animal models, altered expression of Fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP) has been linked to downregulation of GABA receptors. Interestingly, the
autistic phenotype is also observed in individuals with Fragile X syndrome. This 
study was undertaken to test previous theories relating abnormalities in levels
of FMRP to GABA(A) receptor underexpression. We observed a significant reduction 
in levels of FMRP in the vermis of adults with autism. Additionally, we found
that levels of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) protein were
significantly increased in vermis of children with autism versus age and
postmortem interval matched controls. There was also a significant decrease in
level of GABA(A) receptor beta 3 (GABRβ3) protein in vermis of adult subjects
with autism. Finally, we found significant increases in glial fibrillary acidic
protein in vermis of both children and adults with autism when compared with
controls. Taken together, our results provide further evidence that altered FMRP 
expression and increased mGluR5 protein production potentially lead to altered
expression of GABA(A) receptors.

What can we learn about autism from studying fragile X syndrome?

Budimirovic DB(1), Kaufmann WE.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Genetic Disorders of Cognition and Behavior, Kennedy Krieger
Institute, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

Despite early controversy, it is now accepted that a substantial proportion of
children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) meets diagnostic criteria for autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). This change has led to an increased interest in studying
the association of FXS and ASD because of the clinical consequences of their
co-occurrence and the implications for a better understanding of ASD in the
general population. Here, we review the current knowledge on the behavioral,
neurobiological (i.e., neuroimaging), and molecular features of ASD in FXS, as
well as the insight into ASD gained from mouse models of FXS. This review covers 
critical issues such as the selectivity of ASD in disorders associated with
intellectual disability, differences between autistic features and ASD diagnosis,
and the relationship between ASD and anxiety in FXS patients and animal models.
While solid evidence supporting ASD in FXS as a distinctive entity is emerging,
neurobiological and molecular data are still scarce. Animal model studies have
not been particularly revealing about ASD in FXS either. Nevertheless, recent
studies provide intriguing new leads and suggest that a better understanding of
the bases of ASD will require the integration of multidisciplinary data from FXS 
and other genetic disorders.

The psychiatric presentation of fragile x: evolution of the diagnosis and
treatment of the psychiatric comorbidities of fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and
autism spectrum disorders worldwide. It presents with a distinct behavioral
phenotype which overlaps significantly with that of autism. Unlike autism and
most common psychiatric disorders, the neurobiology of fragile X is relatively
well understood. Lack of the fragile X mental retardation protein causes
dysregulation of synaptically driven protein synthesis, which in turn causes
global disruption of synaptic plasticity. Thus, FXS can be considered a disorder 
of synaptic plasticity, and a developmental disorder in the purest sense:
mutation of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene results in abnormal
synaptic development in response to experience. Accumulation of this abnormal
synaptic development, over time, leads to a characteristic and surprisingly
consistent behavioral phenotype of attention deficit, hyperactivity, impulsivity,
multiple anxiety symptoms, repetitive/perseverative/stereotypic behaviors,
unstable affect, aggression, and self-injurious behavior. Many features of the
behavioral and psychiatric phenotype of FXS follow a developmental course, waxing
and waning over the life span. In most cases, symptoms present as a mixed
clinical picture, not fitting established diagnostic categories. There have been 
many clinical trials in fragile X subjects, but no placebo-controlled trials of
adequate size or methodology utilizing the most commonly prescribed psychiatric
medications. However, large and well-designed trials of investigational agents
which target the underlying pathology of FXS have recently been completed or are 
under way. While the literature offers little guidance to the clinician treating 
patients with FXS today, potentially disease-modifying treatments may be
available in the near future.

For over a decade, folic acid (FA) supplementation has been widely prescribed to 
pregnant women to prevent neural tube closure defects in newborns. Although
neural tube closure occurs within the first trimester, high doses of FA are given
throughout pregnancy, the physiological consequences of which are unknown. FA can
cause epigenetic modification of the cytosine residues in the CpG dinucleotide,
thereby affecting gene expression. Dysregulation of crucial gene expression
during gestational development may have lifelong adverse effects or lead to
neurodevelopmental defects, such as autism. We have investigated the effect of FA
supplementation on gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells by whole-genome
expression microarrays. The results showed that high FA caused dysregulation by ≥
four-fold up or down to more than 1000 genes, including many imprinted genes. The
aberrant expression of three genes (FMR1, GPR37L1, TSSK3) was confirmed by
Western blot analyses. The level of altered gene expression changed in an FA
concentration-dependent manner. We found significant dysregulation in gene
expression at concentrations as low as 15 ng/ml, a level that is lower than what 
has been achieved in the blood through FA fortification guidelines. We found
evidence of aberrant promoter methylation in the CpG island of the TSSK3 gene.
Excessive FA supplementation may require careful monitoring in women who are
planning for, or are in the early stages of pregnancy. Aberrant expression of
genes during early brain development may have an impact on behavioural
characteristics.

Cognitive Research, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University, 1081 HV

Neuronal theories of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) of autism and mental
retardation propose that abnormal connectivity underlies deficits in attentional 
processing. We tested this theory by studying unitary synaptic connections
between layer 5 pyramidal neurons within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) networks
in the Fmr1-KO mouse model for mental retardation and autism. In line with
predictions from neurocognitive theory, we found that neighboring pyramidal
neurons were hyperconnected during a critical period in early mPFC development.
Surprisingly, excitatory synaptic connections between Fmr1-KO pyramidal neurons
were significantly slower and failed to recover from short-term depression as
quickly as wild type (WT) synapses. By 4-5 weeks of mPFC development,
connectivity rates were identical for both KO and WT pyramidal neurons and
synapse dynamics changed from depressing to facilitating responses with similar
properties in both groups. We propose that the early alteration in connectivity
and synaptic recovery are tightly linked: using a network model, we show that
slower synapses are essential to counterbalance hyperconnectivity in order to
maintain a dynamic range of excitatory activity. However, the slow synaptic time 
constants induce decreased responsiveness to low-frequency stimulation, which may
explain deficits in integration and early information processing in attentional
neuronal networks in NDDs.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.

Leehey MA(1), Hagerman PJ.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurology, University of Colorado at Denver Health Sciences
Center, Denver, CO, USA. maureen.leehey@ucdenver.edu

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an under-recognized
disorder that is a significant cause of late-adult-onset ataxia. The etiology is 
expansion of a trinucleotide repeat to the premutation range (55-200 CGG repeats)
in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Expansion to >200 CGGs causes 
fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable cause of cognitive impairment and
autism. Core features of FXTAS include progressive action tremor and gait ataxia;
with frequent, more variable features of cognitive decline, especially executive 
dysfunction, parkinsonism, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction. MR imaging
shows generalized atrophy and frequently abnormal signal in the middle cerebellar
peduncles. Autopsy reveals intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes and 
dystrophic white matter. FXTAS is likely due to an RNA toxic gain-of-function of 
the expanded-repeat mRNA. The disorder typically affects male premutation
carriers over age 50, and, less often, females. Females also are at increased
risk for primary ovarian insufficiency, chronic muscle pain, and thyroid disease.
Treatment targets specific symptoms, but progression of disability is relentless.
Although the contribution of FXTAS to the morbidity and mortality of the aging
population requires further study, the disorder is likely the most common
single-gene form of tremor and ataxia in the older adult population.

Impaired inhibitory control of cortical synchronization in fragile X syndrome.

Author information: 
(1)Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe
cognitive impairments, sensory hypersensitivity, and comorbidities with autism
and epilepsy. Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse models of FXS exhibit alterations in
excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, but it is largely unknown how
aberrant function of specific neuronal subtypes contributes to these deficits. In
this study we show specific inhibitory circuit dysfunction in layer II/III of
somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. We demonstrate reduced activation of
somatostatin-expressing low-threshold-spiking (LTS) interneurons in response to
the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist
3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in Fmr1 KO mice, resulting in impaired synaptic
inhibition. Paired recordings from pyramidal neurons revealed reductions in
synchronized synaptic inhibition and coordinated spike synchrony in response to
DHPG, indicating a weakened LTS interneuron network in Fmr1 KO mice. Together,
these findings reveal a functional defect in a single subtype of cortical
interneuron in Fmr1 KO mice. This defect is linked to altered activity of the
cortical network in line with the FXS phenotype.

Abnormal presynaptic short-term plasticity and information processing in a mouse

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability and the leading genetic cause of autism. It is associated with the
lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a regulator of protein
synthesis in axons and dendrites. Studies on FXS have extensively focused on the 
postsynaptic changes underlying dysfunctions in long-term plasticity. In
contrast, the presynaptic mechanisms of FXS have garnered relatively little
attention and are poorly understood. Activity-dependent presynaptic processes
give rise to several forms of short-term plasticity (STP), which is believed to
control some of essential neural functions, including information processing,
working memory, and decision making. The extent of STP defects and their
contributions to the pathophysiology of FXS remain essentially unknown, however. 
Here we report marked presynaptic abnormalities at excitatory hippocampal
synapses in Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice leading to defects in STP and information
processing. Loss of FMRP led to enhanced responses to high-frequency stimulation.
Fmr1 KO mice also exhibited abnormal synaptic processing of natural stimulus
trains, specifically excessive enhancement during the high-frequency spike
discharges associated with hippocampal place fields. Analysis of individual STP
components revealed strongly increased augmentation and reduced short-term
depression attributable to loss of FMRP. These changes were associated with
exaggerated calcium influx in presynaptic neurons during high-frequency
stimulation, enhanced synaptic vesicle recycling, and enlarged readily-releasable
and reserved vesicle pools. These data suggest that loss of FMRP causes abnormal 
STP and information processing, which may represent a novel mechanism
contributing to cognitive impairments in FXS.

FMRP loss of function causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic features. FMRP
is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that it
plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been little
consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, we use
high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation
(HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs.
FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and
postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders
(ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing
that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target mRNAs. Our
results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset
of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, they provide insight into
the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in FXS and ASD and
suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention.

Comment in
    Biol Psychiatry. 2011 Nov 1;70(9):802-3.

BACKGROUND: The fragile X premutation provides a unique opportunity for the study
of genetic and brain mechanisms of behavior and cognition in the context of
neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Although the neurodegenerative phenotype,
fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, is well described, evidence of a
causal link between the premutation and psychiatric disorder earlier in life,
clear delineation of a behavioral/cognitive phenotype, and characterization of
the physiological basis of observed symptoms have been elusive.
METHODS: We completed functional magnetic resonance imaging targeting the
amygdala with an emotion-matching task and concurrent infrared eye tracking, FMR1
molecular genetic testing, and neuropsychological assessment in 23 men with the
premutation (mean age = 32.9 years) and 25 male control subjects (mean age = 30.1
years).
RESULTS: Premutation carriers had significantly smaller left and right amygdala
volume and reduced right amygdala activation during the task relative to control 
subjects. Although both elevated FMR1 messenger RNA and reduced fragile X mental 
retardation protein (FMRP) were associated with the reduced activation, multiple 
regression analysis suggested that reduced FMRP is the primary factor.
Premutation carriers also had higher ratings of autism spectrum symptoms than
control subjects, which were associated with the reduced amygdala response.
CONCLUSIONS: Although prior studies have emphasized a toxic gain-of-function
effect of elevated messenger RNA associated with the premutation, the current
results point to the role of reduced FMRP in alterations of brain activity and
behavior.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability and is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at Xq27.3 on the FMR1 gene.
The majority of young boys with FXS display poor attention and hyperactivity that
is disproportionate to their cognitive disability, and approximately 70% meet
diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Psychopharmacology is employed with 82% of young males 5-17 years of age, with
stimulant medication as the most common medication prescribed. This study
evaluated the effects of stimulant medication on the academic performance,
attention, motor activity, and psychophysiological arousal of boys with FXS, as
well as the concordance of effects within individuals. Participants in this study
included 12 boys with FXS who were treated with stimulants. Participants
completed videotaped academic testing on two consecutive days and were randomly
assigned to be off stimulants for 1 day and on stimulants the other day. On each 
day, multiple measures including academic performance, behavior regulation, and
psychophysiological arousal were collected. Approximately 75% of participants
performed better on attention and academic measures, and 70% showed improved
physiological regulation while on stimulant medication. A high degree of
concordance among measures was found. Lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but not
age, correlated with greater improvements in in-seat behavior. IQ and age did not
relate to on-task behaviors. The frequency and magnitude of response to stimulant
medication in boys with FXS is higher than those reported for most children with 
non-specific intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of the fragile X mental retardation 1
(FMR1) product (FMRP), is the most common cause of inherited intellectual
disability and autism spectrum disorders. FXS patients suffer multiple behavioral
symptoms, including hyperactivity, disrupted circadian cycles, and learning and
memory deficits. Recently, a study in the mouse FXS model showed that the
tetracycline derivative minocycline effectively remediates the disease state via 
a proposed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition mechanism. Here, we use the 
well-characterized Drosophila FXS model to assess the effects of minocycline
treatment on multiple neural circuit morphological defects and to investigate the
MMP hypothesis. We first treat Drosophila Fmr1 (dfmr1) null animals with
minocycline to assay the effects on mutant synaptic architecture in three
disparate locations: the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), clock neurons in the
circadian activity circuit and Kenyon cells in the mushroom body learning and
memory center. We find that minocycline effectively restores normal synaptic
structure in all three circuits, promising therapeutic potential for FXS
treatment. We next tested the MMP hypothesis by assaying the effects of
overexpressing the sole Drosophila tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) in dfmr1 null
mutants. We find that TIMP overexpression effectively prevents defects in the NMJ
synaptic architecture in dfmr1 mutants. Moreover, co-removal of dfmr1 similarly
rescues TIMP overexpression phenotypes, including cellular tracheal defects and
lethality. To further test the MMP hypothesis, we generated dfmr1;mmp1 double
null mutants. Null mmp1 mutants are 100% lethal and display cellular tracheal
defects, but co-removal of dfmr1 allows adult viability and prevents tracheal
defects. Conversely, co-removal of mmp1 ameliorates the NMJ synaptic architecture
defects in dfmr1 null mutants, despite the lack of detectable difference in MMP1 
expression or gelatinase activity between the single dfmr1 mutants and controls. 
These results support minocycline as a promising potential FXS treatment and
suggest that it might act via MMP inhibition. We conclude that FMRP and TIMP
pathways interact in a reciprocal, bidirectional manner.

It is generally thought that fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) 
represents a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder occuring in male carriers of a
premutation expansion (55-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 
(FMR 1) gene. However, several female patients with FXTAS have also been reported
recently. Here, we describe a 23-year old woman with positive family history of
mental retardation and autism who presented clinically with action tremor,
ataxia, emotional disturbances and cognitive dysfunction. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the brain showed diffuse cortical atrophy, while 1H-MR
spectroscopy (MRS) revealed decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the
cerebellum, basal ganglia, and pons. Genetic testing confirmed heterozygous FMR 1
gene premutation of 100 CGG repeats in the abnormal allele and 29 CGG repeats in 
the normal allele. We concluded that FXTAS may be an under-recognized disorder,
particularly in women.

Increased frequency of occult fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency 
in infertile women with evidence of impaired ovarian function.

BACKGROUND: The FMR1 premutation is associated with overt primary ovarian
insufficiency (POI). However, its prevalence in women with occult POI (i.e.
menstrual cycles, but impaired ovarian response) has not been examined. We
hypothesized that both the FMR1 premutation and intermediate allele is more
frequent in infertile women with occult POI than in controls, and that a repeat
length cutoff might predict occult POI.
METHODS: All subjects were menstruating women <42 years old and with no family
history of unexplained mental retardation, autism or fragile X syndrome. Cases
had occult POI defined by elevated FSH or poor response to gonadotrophin therapy 
(n = 535). Control subjects (n = 521) had infertility from other causes or were
oocyte donors. Prevalence of the FMR1 premutation and intermediate alleles was
examined and allele length was compared between controls and women with occult
POI.
RESULTS: The frequency of the premutation (7/535 versus 1/521; P< 0.05) and
intermediate alleles (17/535 versus 7/521; P< 0.05) was higher in women with
occult POI than in controls. The allele with the greatest number of CGG repeats
was longer in women with occult POI compared with controls (32.7 ± 7.1 versus
31.6 ± 4.3; P < 0.01). A receiver operating characteristic curve examining repeat
length as a test for occult POI had an area of 0.56 ± 0.02 (P < 0.01). A repeat
cutoff of 45 had a specificity of 98%, but a sensitivity of only 5% to identify
occult POI. The positive predictive value was only 21% for a fertility population
that has ∼ 22% of its patients with occult POI.
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that FMR1 premutations and intermediate alleles are
increased in women with occult POI. Thus, FMR1 testing should be performed in
these women as some will have fragileX-associated POI. Although the FMR1 repeat
lengths were longer in women with occult POI, the data do not support the use of 
a repeat length cutoff to predict occult POI.

FMR1 premutation and full mutation molecular mechanisms related to autism.

Sacramento, CA, USA, Randi.hagerman@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (>200 repeats) in
the 5' un-translated portion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1)
leading to a deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an
RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of a number of other genes
that are important for synaptic development and plasticity. Furthermore, many of 
these genes, when mutated, have been linked to autism in the general population, 
which may explain the high comorbidity that exists between FXS and autism
spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 
CGG repeats) may also give rise to ASD through a different molecular mechanism
that involves a direct toxic effect of FMR1 mRNA. It is believed that RNA
toxicity underlies much of the premutation-related involvement, including
developmental concerns like autism, as well as neurodegenerative issues with
aging such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). RNA
toxicity can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is common in older
premutation carriers both with and without FXTAS. Many of the problems with
cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also
parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in idiopathic
autism. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems caused by
the lack of FMRP in FXS, including metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5 (mGluR1/5)
pathway and GABA pathways, has led to new targeted treatments for FXS.
Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be
beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

Heritable neurodevelopmental disorders are multifaceted disease conditions
encompassing a wide range of symptoms including intellectual disability,
cognitive dysfunction, autism and myriad other behavioral impairments. In cases
where single, causative genetic defects have been identified, such as Angelman
syndrome, Rett syndrome, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Fragile X syndrome, the
classical Drosophila genetic system has provided fruitful disease models. Recent 
Drosophila studies have advanced our understanding of UBE3A, MECP2, NF1 and FMR1 
function, respectively, in genetic, biochemical, anatomical, physiological and
behavioral contexts. Investigations in Drosophila continue to provide the
essential mechanistic understanding required to facilitate the conception of
rational therapeutic treatments.

Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for programmed cell death and
clearance of developmentally-transient peptidergic neurons.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)
gene function, is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and 
autism spectrum disorders. The FMR1 product (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein best
established to function in activity-dependent modulation of synaptic connections.
In the Drosophila FXS disease model, loss of functionally-conserved dFMRP causes 
synaptic overgrowth and overelaboration in pigment dispersing factor (PDF)
peptidergic neurons in the adult brain. Here, we identify a very different
component of PDF neuron misregulation in dfmr1 mutants: the aberrant retention of
normally developmentally-transient PDF tritocerebral (PDF-TRI) neurons. In
wild-type animals, PDF-TRI neurons in the central brain undergo programmed cell
death and complete, processive clearance within days of eclosion. In the absence 
of dFMRP, a defective apoptotic program leads to constitutive maintenance of
these peptidergic neurons. We tested whether this apoptotic defect is
circuit-specific by examining crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) and bursicon
circuits, which are similarly developmentally-transient and normally eliminated
immediately post-eclosion. In dfmr1 null mutants, CCAP/bursicon neurons also
exhibit significantly delayed clearance dynamics, but are subsequently eliminated
from the nervous system, in contrast to the fully persistent PDF-TRI neurons.
Thus, the requirement of dFMRP for the retention of transitory peptidergic
neurons shows evident circuit specificity. The novel defect of impaired apoptosis
and aberrant neuron persistence in the Drosophila FXS model suggests an entirely 
new level of "pruning" dysfunction may contribute to the FXS disease state.

receptor 5 in superior frontal cortex of individuals with autism: a postmortem
brain study.

BACKGROUND: Fragile × syndrome is caused by loss of function of the fragile ×
mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and shares multiple phenotypes with autism. We
have previously found reduced expression of the protein product of FMR1 (FMRP) in
vermis of adults with autism.
METHODS: In the current study, we have investigated levels of FMRP in the
superior frontal cortex of people with autism and matched controls using Western 
blot analysis. Because FMRP regulates the translation of multiple genes, we also 
measured protein levels for downstream molecules metabotropic glutamate receptor 
5 (mGluR5) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor β3 (GABRβ3), as well as
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
RESULTS: We observed significantly reduced levels of protein for FMRP in adults
with autism, significantly increased levels of protein for mGluR5 in children
with autism and significantly increased levels of GFAP in adults and children
with autism. We found no change in expression of GABRβ3. Our results for FMRP,
mGluR5 and GFAP confirm our previous work in the cerebellar vermis of people with
autism.
CONCLUSION: These changes may be responsible for cognitive deficits and seizure
disorder in people with autism.

Gender-specific effect of Mthfr genotype and neonatal vigabatrin interaction on
synaptic proteins in mouse cortex.

The enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a part of the
homocysteine and folate metabolic pathways, affecting the methylations of DNA,
RNA, and proteins. Mthfr deficiency was reported as a risk factor for
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. 
Neonatal disruption of the GABAergic system is also associated with behavioral
outcomes. The interaction between the epigenetic influence of Mthfr deficiency
and neonatal exposure to the GABA potentiating drug vigabatrin (GVG) in mice has 
been shown to have gender-dependent effects on mice anxiety and to have memory
impairment effects in a gender-independent manner. Here we show that Mthfr
deficiency interacts with neonatal GABA potentiation to alter social behavior in 
female, but not male, mice. This impairment was associated with a
gender-dependent enhancement of proteins implicated in excitatory synapse
plasticity in the female cortex. Reelin and fragile X mental retardation 1
protein (FMRP) levels and membrane GluR1/GluR2 ratios were elevated in wild-type 
mice treated neonatally with GVG and in Mthfr+/- mice treated with saline, but
not in Mthfr+/- mice treated with GVG, compared with control groups (wild type
treated with saline). A minor influence on the levels of these proteins was
observed in male mice cortices, possibly due to high basal protein levels.
Interaction between gender, genotype, and treatment was also observed in the GABA
pathway. In female mice, GABA Aα2/gephyrin ratios were suppressed in all test
groups; in male mice, a genotype-specific enhancement of GABA Aα2/gephyrin was
observed. The lack of an effect on either reln or Fmr1 transcription suggests
post-transcriptional regulation of these genes. Taken together, these findings
suggest that Mthfr deficiency may interact with neonatal GABA potentiation in a
gender-dependent manner to interrupt synaptic function. This may illustrate a
possible mechanism for the epigenetic involvement of Mthfr deficiency in
neurodevelopmental disorders.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common identifiable genetic cause of
intellectual disability and autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), with up to 50% of 
males and some females with FXS meeting criteria for ASD. Autistic features are
present in a very high percent of individuals with FXS, even those who do not
meet full criteria for ASD. Recent major advances have been made in the
understanding of the neurobiology and functions of FMRP, the FMR1 (fragile X
mental retardation 1) gene product, which is absent or reduced in FXS, largely
based on work in the fmr1 knockout mouse model. FXS has emerged as a disorder of 
synaptic plasticity associated with abnormalities of long-term depression and
long-term potentiation and immature dendritic spine architecture, related to the 
dysregulation of dendritic translation typically activated by group I mGluR and
other receptors. This work has led to efforts to develop treatments for FXS with 
neuroactive molecules targeted to the dysregulated translational pathway. These
agents have been shown to rescue molecular, spine, and behavioral phenotypes in
the FXS mouse model at multiple stages of development. Clinical trials are
underway to translate findings in animal models of FXS to humans, raising complex
issues about trial design and outcome measures to assess cognitive change that
might be associated with treatment. Genes known to be causes of ASD interact with
the translational pathway defective in FXS, and it has been hypothesized that
there will be substantial overlap in molecular pathways and mechanisms of
synaptic dysfunction between FXS and ASD. Therefore, targeted treatments
developed for FXS may also target subgroups of ASD, and clinical trials in FXS
may serve as a model for the development of clinical trial strategies for ASD and
other cognitive disorders.

FMR1 premutation alleles.

5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) are important regulators of gene
expression and play key roles in disease progression and susceptibility. The
5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene contains a CGG repeat
element that is expanded (>200 CGG repeats; full mutation) and methylated in
fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability (ID) and known cause of autism. Significant phenotypic involvement has
also emerged in some individuals with the premutation (55-200 CGG repeats),
including fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in
females, and the neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia
syndrome (FXTAS), in older adult carriers. Here, we show that FMR1 mRNA in human 
and mouse brain is expressed as a combination of multiple isoforms that use
alternative transcriptional start sites and different polyadenylation sites.
Furthermore, we have identified a novel human transcription start site used in
brain but not in lymphoblastoid cells, and have detected FMR1 isoforms generated 
through the use of both canonical and non-canonical polyadenylation signals.
Importantly, in both human and mouse, a specific regulation of the UTRs is
observed in brain of FMR1 premutation alleles, suggesting that the transcript
variants may play a role in premutation-related pathologies.

Clinical assessment of DSM-IV anxiety disorders in fragile X syndrome: prevalence
and characterization.

Cordeiro L, Ballinger E, Hagerman R, Hessl D.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual
disability (ID). Anxiety and social withdrawal are considered core features of
the FXS phenotype, yet there is limited diagnostic evidence of the prevalence of 
formal anxiety disorders in FXS. This study assessed the prevalence of anxiety
disorders in a sample of 58 males and 39 females with FXS (ages 5.0-33.3 years). 
Participants' parents completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule
(ADIS-IV), a clinical interview based on DSM-IV criteria, and the Anxiety
Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS), a psychiatric disorders screening instrument
normed in ID. We conducted cognitive (IQ) and autism (AUT) assessments and
surveyed medication use. Despite a high rate of psychopharmacological treatment, 
86.2% of males and 76.9% of females met criteria for an anxiety disorder, with
social phobia and specific phobia the most commonly diagnosed. Proband status,
gender, and IQ were not significantly related to any anxiety disorders, however
significantly higher rates of a few anxiety disorders were found in older age and
AUT groups. Significant correlations between ADIS diagnoses and ADAMS scores
provided cross-validation of instruments, indicating that the ADIS is suitable
for use in FXS. A greater percentage of our sample met criteria for most anxiety 
disorders than has been reported in other ID groups or the general population.
The rate of anxiety compared to general ID suggests that the FMR1 full mutation
confers an especially high risk for these disorders, regardless of factors
commonly associated with FXS clinical involvement. A thorough clinical assessment
and treatment of anxiety should be included in the FXS standard of care.

During the last few years, several studies have reported an excess of
intermediate FMR1 alleles in patients with cognitive and/or behavioural
phenotypes. Here, we report the frequency of intermediate alleles (IAs) in three 
pathologies, intellectual disabilities (IDs), attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder and autism, from different Spanish regions. We found 142 IAs among 9015 
patients with ID (1.6%), 4 among the 415 ADHD patients (0.96%) and 4 among the
300 autistic patients (1.3%), similar to the frequency reported in our control
population. No evidence was found of an excess of IA at the FRAXA locus in any of
the study populations, although geographical variability was detected. Moreover, 
the analysis of 100 transmissions of IAs showed that 95% of these alleles were
stable. Only 3% expanded within the same range and 2% expanded to a full mutation
in two generations. No evidence of an association between IAs and behavioural or 
cognitive phenotypes was found, suggesting that IAs are not clearly implicated in
these pathologies.

Genetic-background modulation of core and variable autistic-like symptoms in Fmr1
knock-out mice.

de Bordeaux and CNRS UMR 5287, Talence, France.

BACKGROUND: No animal models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with good
construct validity are currently available; using genetic models of pathologies
characterized by ASD-like deficits, but with known causes, may be therefore a
promising strategy. The Fmr1-KO mouse is an example of this approach, modeling
Fragile X syndrome, a well-known genetic disorder presenting ASD symptoms. The
Fmr1-KO is available on different genetic backgrounds (FVB versus C57BL/6), which
may explain some of the conflicting results that have been obtained with these
mutants up till now.
METHODS: Fmr1 KO and their wild-type littermates on both the FVB and C57BL/6
genetic backgrounds were examined on a battery of tests modeling the clinical
symptoms of ASD, including the triad of core symptoms (alterations in social
interaction and communication, presence of repetitive behaviors), as well as the 
secondary symptoms (disturbances in sensori-motor reactivity and in circadian
patterns of activity, epileptic events).
RESULTS: Fmr1-KO mice displayed autistic-like core symptoms of altered social
interaction and occurrence of repetitive behaviors with additional hyperactivity.
The genetic background modulated the effects of the Fmr1 deletion and it appears 
that the C57BL/6 background may be more suitable for further research on core
autistic-like symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The Fmr1-mouse line does not recapitulate all of the main core and
secondary ASD symptoms, but still can be useful to elucidate the neurobiological 
mechanisms underlying specific ASD-like endophenotypes.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in reciprocal
social communication, and stereotyped verbal and nonverbal behaviors. In
approximately 10-25% of the affected individuals, a genetic mutation associated
with the condition can be identified. Recently, mutations altering synapse
formation, cellular/synaptic growth rate and regulation of excitatory and
inhibitory currents were identified in patients with intellectual disability,
typical autism, Asperger syndrome or neurological syndromes associated with
autistic traits. Following these genetic findings, mouse models carrying
mutations similar to those identified in patients have been generated. These
models offer the opportunity to investigate in vivo the physiological and
behavioral consequences of the mutations. Here, we review the existing data on
the phenotypes of mice carrying mutations in genes associated with ASD including 
neuroligin, neurexin and Shank mutant mice as well as the Fmr1, Mecp2, Ube3a,
Nf1, Pten and Tsc1/Tsc2 mutant mice. The diversity and complexity of the
phenotype of these mouse models reflect the broad range of phenotypes observed in
patients with ASD. Remarkably, results from therapeutic approaches (e.g.,
modulation of gene expression, administration of pharmacological and
nonpharmacological substances, enriched environment) are encouraging since some
behavioral alterations could be reversed even when treatment was performed on
adult mice. These ongoing studies should therefore increase our understanding of 
the biological alterations associated with ASD as well as the development of
knowledge-based treatments.

Cellular stress-induced up-regulation of FMRP promotes cell survival by
modulating PI3K-Akt phosphorylation cascades.

Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most commonly inherited mental
retardation and single gene cause of autistic spectrum disorder, occurs when the 
Fmr1 gene is mutated. The product of Fmr1, fragile X linked mental retardation
protein (FMRP) is widely expressed in HeLa cells, however the roles of FMRP
within HeLa cells were not elucidated, yet. Interacting with a diverse range of
mRNAs related to cellular survival regulatory signals, understanding the
functions of FMRP in cellular context would provide better insights into the role
of this interesting protein in FXS. Using HeLa cells treated with etoposide as a 
model, we tried to determine whether FMRP could play a role in cell survival.
METHODS: Apoptotic cell death was induced by etoposide treatment on Hela cells.
After we transiently modulated FMRP expression (silencing or enhancing) by using 
molecular biotechnological methods such as small hairpin RNA virus-induced knock 
down and overexpression using transfection with FMRP expression vectors, cellular
viability was measured using propidium iodide staining, TUNEL staining, and FACS 
analysis along with the level of activation of PI3K-Akt pathway by Western blot. 
Expression level of FMRP and apoptotic regulator BcL-xL was analyzed by Western
blot, RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry.
RESULTS: An increased FMRP expression was measured in etoposide-treated HeLa
cells, which was induced by PI3K-Akt activation. Without FMRP expression,
cellular defence mechanism via PI3K-Akt-Bcl-xL was weakened and resulted in an
augmented cell death by etoposide. In addition, FMRP over-expression lead to the 
activation of PI3K-Akt signalling pathway as well as increased FMRP and BcL-xL
expression, which culminates with the increased cell survival in
etoposide-treated HeLa cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that FMRP expression is an
essential part of cellular survival mechanisms through the modulation of PI3K,
Akt, and Bcl-xL signal pathways.

Using data from a national family survey, the authors describe the adult lives
(i.e., residence, employment, level of assistance needed with everyday life,
friendships, and leisure activities) of 328 adults with the full mutation of the 
FMR1 gene and identify characteristics related to independence in these domains. 
Level of functional skills was the strongest predictor of independence in adult
life for men, whereas ability to interact appropriately was the strongest
predictor for women. Co-occurring mental health conditions influenced
independence in adult life for men and women, in particular, autism spectrum
disorders for men and affect problems for women. Services for adults with fragile
X syndrome should not only target functional skills but interpersonal skills and 
co-occurring mental health conditions.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual
disability in humans. In addition to cognitive impairment, patients may exhibit
hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties and anxiety, and
autistic-like behaviors. The degree to which patients display these behaviors
varies considerably and is influenced by family history, suggesting that genetic 
modifiers play a role in the expression of behaviors in FXS. Several studies have
examined behavior in a mouse model of FXS in which the Fmr1 gene has been
ablated. Most of those studies were done in Fmr1 knockout mice on a pure C57BL/6 
or FVB strain background. To gain a better understanding of the effects of
genetic background on behaviors resulting from the loss of Fmr1 gene expression, 
we generated F1 hybrid lines from female Fmr1 heterozygous mice on a pure
C57BL/6J background bred with male Fmr1 wild-type (WT) mice of various background
strains (A/J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, 129S1/SvImJ and CD-1). Male Fmr1 knockout and WT
littermates from each line were examined in an extensive behavioral test battery.
Results clearly indicate that multiple behavioral responses are dependent on
genetic background, including autistic-like traits that are present on limited
genetic backgrounds. This approach has allowed us to identify improved models for
different behavioral symptoms present in FXS including autistic-like traits.

TMS: using the theta-burst protocol to explore mechanism of plasticity in
individuals with Fragile X syndrome and autism.

Author information:

Medical Center.

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), also known as Martin-Bell Syndrome, is a genetic
abnormality found on the X chromosome. Individuals suffering from FXS display
abnormalities in the expression of FMR1--a protein required for typical, healthy 
neural development. Recent data has suggested that the loss of this protein can
cause the cortex to be hyperexcitable thereby affecting overall patterns of
neural plasticity. In addition, Fragile X shows a strong comorbidity with autism:
in fact, 30% of children with FXS are diagnosed with autism, and 2-5% of autistic
children suffer from FXS. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (a non-invasive
neurostimulatory and neuromodulatory technique that can transiently or lastingly 
modulate cortical excitability via the application of localized magnetic field
pulses) represents a unique method of exploring plasticity and the manifestations
of FXS within affected individuals. More specifically, Theta-Burst Stimulation
(TBS), a specific stimulatory protocol shown to modulate cortical plasticity for 
a duration up to 30 minutes after stimulation cessation in healthy populations,
has already proven an efficacious tool in the exploration of abnormal plasticity.
Recent studies have shown the effects of TBS last considerably longer in
individuals on the autistic spectrum--up to 90 minutes. This extended
effect-duration suggests an underlying abnormality in the brain's natural
plasticity state in autistic individuals, similar to the hyperexcitability
induced by Fragile X Syndrome. In this experiment, utilizing single-pulse
motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as our benchmark, we will explore the effects of
both intermittent and continuous TBS on cortical plasticity in individuals
suffering from FXS and individuals on the Autistic Spectrum.

Carriers of FMR1 premutation alleles have 55-200 CGG repeats in the 5'
untranslated region of the gene. These individuals are at risk for fragile X
associated primary ovarian insufficiency (females) and, in late life, fragile X
associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (males, and to a lesser extent, females).
Premutation carrier status can also be associated with autism spectrum disorder, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and some cognitive deficits. In
premutation carriers, FMR1 mRNA levels are often higher than those with normal
sized alleles. In contrast, in subjects with full mutation alleles, (>200
repeats) the FMR1 gene is silenced and FMR1 mRNA and its product, FMRP, are
absent. We have studied a male knock-in (KI) mouse model of the fragile X
premutation (120-140 repeats) during young adulthood. In comparison to wild type,
KI mice were hyperactive, exhibited less anxiety in both the open field and the
elevated zero maze, were impaired on the passive avoidance test, and showed some 
subtle deficits on a test of social interaction. Motor learning as assessed by
the rotarod test was normal. Dendritic arbors were less complex and spine
densities and lengths increased in medial prefrontal cortex, basal lateral
amygdala, and hippocampus compared with wild type. Regional rates of cerebral
protein synthesis measured in vivo in KI mice were increased. KI mice also had
elevated levels of Fmr1 mRNA and decreased levels of FMRP. Our results highlight 
similarities in phenotype between KI and Fmr1 knockout mice and suggest that the 
decreased concentration of FMRP contributes to the phenotype in young adult KI
mice.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited mental retardation, 
is caused by the loss of the mRNA binding protein, FMRP. Persons with FXS also
display epileptic seizures, social anxiety, hyperactivity, and autistic
behaviors. The metabotropic glutamate receptor theory of FXS postulates that in
the absence of FMRP, enhanced signaling though G-protein coupled group I
metabotropic glutamate receptors in the brain contributes to many of the
abnormalities observed in the disorder. However, recent evidence suggests that
alterations in cellular signaling through additional G-protein coupled receptors 
may also be involved in the pathogenesis of FXS, thus providing impetus for
examining downstream molecules. One group of signaling molecules situated
downstream of the receptors is the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)
proteins. Notably, RGS4 is highly expressed in brain and has been shown to
negatively regulate signaling through Group I mGluRs and GABA(B) receptors. To
examine the potential role for RGS4 in the pathogenesis of FXS, we generated
FXS/RGS4 double knockout mice. Characterization of these mice revealed that a
subset of FXS related phenotypes, including increased body weight, altered
synaptic protein expression, and abnormal social behaviors, were rescued in the
double knockout mice. Other phenotypes, such as hyperactivity and macroorchidism,
were not affected by the loss of RGS4. These findings suggest that tissue and
cell-type specific differences in GPCR signaling and RGS function may contribute 
to the spectrum of phenotypic differences observed in FXS.

Fragile X mice: reduced long-term potentiation and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate
receptor-mediated neurotransmission in dentate gyrus.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic mental retardation syndrome that
frequently includes autism. The Fmr1-knockout (Fmr1-KO) mouse, like FXS-affected 
individuals, lacks the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and models
autism as well as FXS. Limited human data and several mouse models have
implicated the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in autism. We therefore
investigated whether the Fmr1-KO mouse exhibited functional changes in DG. We
found diminished medial perforant path-granule cell long-term potentiation (LTP),
complementing previous investigations of synaptic plasticity in Fmr1-KO
demonstrating impaired LTP in CA1, neocortex, and amygdala and exaggerated
long-term depression in CA1. We also found that peak amplitude of NMDA
receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was smaller in Fmr1-KO
than control. AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs were comparable in the two strains,
yielding a lower NMDA/AMPA ratio in Fmr1-KO mice and suggesting one mechanism by 
which absent FMRP might contribute to diminished LTP. The clinical hallmarks of
autism include both excessive adherence to patterns and impaired detection of
socially important patterns. The DG has a putative role in pattern separation
(for time, space, and features) that has been attributed to granule cell number, 
firing rates, adult neurogenesis, and even perforant path LTP. DG also
contributes to pattern completion in CA3 via its mossy fiber efferents, whose
terminals include abundant FMRP in "fragile X granules." Together with the
present data, these observations suggest that DG is a candidate region for
further investigation in autism and that the Fmr1-KO model may be particularly
apt.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is highly enriched in neurons and
binds to approximately 4% of mRNAs in mammalian brain. Its loss is a hallmark of 
fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of mental retardation. In this
review we discuss the mutation in the fragile X mental retardation-1 gene (FMR1),
that leads to FXS, the role FMRP plays in neuronal cells, experiments from our
own laboratory that demonstrate reductions of FMRP in additional psychiatric
disorders (autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive
disorder), and potential therapies to ameliorate the loss of FMRP. This article
is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Trends in neuropharmacology: in memory of

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and a leading monogenic
form of cognitive impairment and autism. It is the most common form of inherited 
mental retardation in males and a significant cause of mental retardation in
females. It is caused by the instability and subsequent expansion of the CGG
repeat in the promoter region of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene
at Xq27.3. We describe a double consanguineous family with four sisters compound 
heterozygotes for the full and pre-mutation CGG repeat size. The index case shows
clinical features of the affected males with profound mental retardation; the
other three sisters also suffer from mental retardation, ranging from mild to
severe. Molecular analysis reveals very similar ranges for the CGG expansions for
both chromosomes in all four sisters. The phenotypic differences observed in the 
index case and her sisters are the total inactivation of X premutated chromosome 
and the total absence of FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein). This family
case raises important issues for genetic counseling in families with
consanguinity and with cases of idiopathic mental retardation.

Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation 
and a leading known cause of autism. It is caused by loss of expression of the
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that
negatively regulates protein synthesis. In neurons, multiple lines of evidence
suggest that protein synthesis at synapses is triggered by activation of group 1 
metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs) and that many functional
consequences of activating these receptors are altered in the absence of FMRP.
These observations have led to the theory that exaggerated protein synthesis
downstream of Gp1 mGluRs is a core pathogenic mechanism in FXS. This excess can
be corrected by reducing signaling by Gp1 mGluRs, and numerous studies have shown
that inhibition of mGluR5, in particular, can ameliorate multiple mutant
phenotypes in animal models of FXS. Clinical trials based on this therapeutic
strategy are currently under way. FXS is therefore poised to be the first
neurobehavioral disorder in which corrective treatments have been developed from 
the bottom up: from gene identification to pathophysiology in animals to novel
therapeutics in humans. The insights gained from FXS and other autism-related
single-gene disorders may also assist in identifying molecular mechanisms and
potential treatment approaches for idiopathic autism.

dFMRP and Caprin, translational regulators of synaptic plasticity, control the
cell cycle at the Drosophila mid-blastula transition.

The molecular mechanisms driving the conserved metazoan developmental shift
referred to as the mid-blastula transition (MBT) remain mysterious. Typically,
cleavage divisions give way to longer asynchronous cell cycles with the
acquisition of a gap phase. In Drosophila, rapid synchronous nuclear divisions
must pause at the MBT to allow the formation of a cellular blastoderm through a
special form of cytokinesis termed cellularization. Drosophila Fragile X mental
retardation protein (dFMRP; FMR1), a transcript-specific translational regulator,
is required for cellularization. The role of FMRP has been most extensively
studied in the nervous system because the loss of FMRP activity in neurons causes
the misexpression of specific mRNAs required for synaptic plasticity, resulting
in mental retardation and autism in humans. Here, we show that in the early
embryo dFMRP associates specifically with Caprin, another transcript-specific
translational regulator implicated in synaptic plasticity, and with eIF4G, a key 
regulator of translational initiation. dFMRP and Caprin collaborate to control
the cell cycle at the MBT by directly mediating the normal repression of maternal
Cyclin B mRNA and the activation of zygotic frühstart mRNA. These findings
identify two new targets of dFMRP regulation and implicate conserved
translational regulatory mechanisms in processes as diverse as learning, memory
and early embryonic development.

The behavioral phenotype of FMR1 mutations.

Author information: 
(1)Kennedy Krieger Institute’s Fragile X Clinic, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the behavioral phenotype
of FMR1 mutations, including fragile X syndrome (FXS) in order to better
understand the clinical involvement of individuals affected by mutations in this 
gene. FXS is associated with a wide range of intellectual and behavioral
problems, some relatively mild and others quite severe. FXS is the most common
cause of inherited intellectual disability and one of the most prevalent genetic 
causes of autism spectrum disorder. Learning difficulties, attentional problems, 
anxiety, aggressive behavior, stereotypies, and mood disorders are also frequent 
in FXS. Recent studies of children and adults have identified associations
between FMR1 premutation and many of the same disorders. We examine the
neurobehavioral phenotypes of FXS and FMR1 premutation as they manifest across
the lifespan of the individual.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a disorder characterized by a variety of 
disabilities, including cognitive deficits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, autism, and other socio-emotional problems. It is hypothesized that the
absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to higher levels
of matrix metallo-proteinase-9 activity (MMP-9) in the brain. Minocycline
inhibits MMP-9 activity, and alleviates behavioural and synapse abnormalities in 
fmr1 knockout mice, an established model for FXS. This open-label add-on pilot
trial was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of minocycline in treating
behavioural abnormalities that occur in humans with FXS.
METHODS: Twenty individuals with FXS, ages 13-32, were randomly assigned to
receive 100 mg or 200 mg of minocycline daily. Behavioural evaluations were made 
prior to treatment (baseline) and again 8 weeks after daily minocycline
treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Aberrant Behaviour
Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-C) Irritability Subscale, and the secondary
outcome measures were the other ABC-C subscales, clinical global improvement
scale (CGI), and the visual analog scale for behaviour (VAS). Side effects were
assessed using an adverse events checklist, a complete blood count (CBC), hepatic
and renal function tests, and antinuclear antibody screen (ANA), done at baseline
and at 8 weeks.
RESULTS: The ABC-C Irritability Subscale scores showed significant improvement (p
< 0.001), as did the VAS (p = 0.003) and the CGI (p < 0.001). The only
significant treatment-related side effects were minor diarrhea (n = 3) and
seroconversion to a positive ANA (n = 2).
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study demonstrate that minocycline provides
significant functional benefits to FXS patients and that it is well-tolerated.
These findings are consistent with the fmr1 knockout mouse model results,
suggesting that minocycline modifies underlying neural defects that account for
behavioural abnormalities. A placebo-controlled trial of minocycline in FXS is
warranted.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 469: Carrier screening for fragile X syndrome.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Genetics.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. The
syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 3,600 males and 1 in 4,000-6,000 females.
Approximately 1 in 250 females carry the premutation. DNA-based molecular
analysis is the preferred method of diagnosis for fragile X syndrome and its
premutations. Prenatal testing for fragile X syndrome should be offered to known 
carriers of the fragile X premutation or full mutation. Women with a family
history of fragile X-related disorders, unexplained mental retardation or
developmental delay, autism, or premature ovarian insufficiency are candidates
for genetic counseling and fragile X premutation carrier screening.

Fragile X and autism: Intertwined at the molecular level leading to targeted
treatments.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (> 200 repeats) in
the 5' untranslated portion of the fragile mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1),
leading to deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA
carrier protein that controls the translation of several other genes that
regulate synaptic development and plasticity. Autism occurs in approximately 30% 
of FXS cases, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified
(PDD-NOS) occurs in an additional 30% of cases. Premutation repeat expansions (55
to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to autism spectrum disorders (ASD),
including both autism and PDD-NOS, through a different molecular mechanism that
involves a direct toxic effect of the expanded CGG repeat FMR1 mRNA. RNA toxicity
can also lead to aging effects including tremor, ataxia and cognitive decline,
termed fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in premutation
carriers in late life. In studies of mice bearing premutation expansions, there
is evidence of early postnatal neuronal cell toxicity, presenting as reduced cell
longevity, decreased dendritic arborization and altered synaptic morphology.
There is also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in premutation carriers. Many
of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation
neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in
autism without fragile X mutations. Research regarding dysregulation of
neurotransmitter systems in FXS, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor
(mGluR)1/5 pathway and γ aminobutyric acid (GABA)A pathways, have led to new
targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new
targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

The distribution of repressive histone modifications on silenced FMR1 alleles
provides clues to the mechanism of gene silencing in fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable cause of intellectual
disability and the most common known cause of autism. Most cases of FXS result
from the expansion of a CGG·CCG repeat in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene that leads 
to gene silencing. It has previously been shown that silenced alleles are
associated with histone H3 dimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9Me2) and H3
trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27Me3), modified histones typical of
developmentally repressed genes. We show here that these alleles are also
associated with elevated levels of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9Me3)
and histone H4 trimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20Me3). All four of these modified 
histones are present on exon 1 of silenced alleles at levels comparable to that
seen on pericentric heterochromatin. The two groups of histone modifications show
a different distribution on fragile X alleles: H3K9Me2 and H3K27Me3 have a broad 
distribution, whereas H3K9Me3 and H4K20Me3 have a more focal distribution with
the highest level of these marks being present in the vicinity of the repeat.
This suggests that the trigger for gene silencing may be local to the repeat
itself and perhaps involves a mechanism similar to that involved in the formation
of pericentric heterochromatin.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome is the most common known genetic cause of autism. 
The Fmr1-KO mouse, lacks the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and is 
used as a model of the syndrome. The core behavioral deficits of autism may be
conceptualized either as excessive adherence to patterns as seen in repetitive
actions and aberrant language, or as insensitivity to subtle but socially
important changes in patterns. The hippocampus receives information from the
entorhinal cortex and plays a crucial role in the processing of patterned
information. To gain more insight into the physiological function of FMRP and the
neuronal mechanisms underlying fragile X syndrome, we examined the
electrophysiological response of the hippocampus to pair pulse stimulation as a
measure of patterned information processing and how it is affected in the Fmr1-KO
mouse.
METHODS: In this study, we used paired-pulse stimulation of the afferent
perforant path and recorded from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Two-month-old
FVB/NJ male mice and age-matched Fmr1-KO mice were used in this study.
Hippocampal slices were prepared, equilibrated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid 
(aCSF), and excitatory post synaptic potentials (EPSPs) measured by stimulating
the perforant path of the dentate gyrus (DG) while recording from the molecular
layer of CA1. Stimulation occurred by setting current and pulse width to evoke a 
fixed percentage of maximal EPSP amplitude. This stimulation paradigm allowed us 
to examine the processing capabilities of the hippocampus as a function of
increasing interstimulus intervals (ISI) and how taurine, a GABAA receptor
agonist, affects such information processing.
RESULTS: We found that hippocampal slices from wild type (WT) showed pair-pulse
facilitation at ISI of 100-300 ms whereas slices from Fmr1-KO brains showed a
consistent pair-pulse depression at a comparable ISI. Addition of 10 muM taurine 
to WT slices resulted in a drastic decrease of the peak response to the second
stimulus, resulting in an initial depression at 100 ms ISI followed by
potentiation at higher ISI (150 ms and above). In the presence of taurine, the
amplitude of the second response remained significantly lower than in its
absence. Fmr1-KO mice however, were completely insensitive to taurine application
and pair-pulse stimulation always resulted in a depression of the response to the
second stimulus.
CONCLUSIONS: Previously we reported that Fmr1-KO mice have reduced beta subunits 
of the GABAA receptors. We also showed as well as others that taurine acts as an 
agonist or a modulator for GABAA receptors. Therefore, the insensitivity of
Fmr1-KO slices to taurine application could be due to the reduced binding sites
on the GABAA receptors in the Fmr1-KO mice.

An increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in family members of children with
autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been previously reported. ASD is also a
common problem co-occurring in children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Why ASD
occurs in some individuals with FXS, but not all, is largely unknown.
Furthermore, in premutation carrier mothers, there is an increased risk for
autoimmune diseases. This study compared the rate of ASD and other
neurodevelopmental/behavioral problems in 61 children with FXS born to 41 carrier
mothers who had autoimmune disease and in 97 children with FXS of 78 carrier
mothers who did not have autoimmune disease. There were no significant
differences in the mean age (9.61 ± 5.59 vs. 9.41 ± 6.31, P = 0.836), cognitive
and adaptive functioning in children of mothers with and without autoimmune
disease. Among children whose mothers had autoimmune disease, the odds ratio (OR)
for ASD was 1.27 (95% CI 0.62-2.61, P = 0.5115). Interestingly, the OR for
seizures and tics was 3.81 (95% CI 1.13-12.86, P = 0.031) and 2.94 (95% CI
1.19-7.24, P = 0.019), respectively, in children of mothers with autoimmune
disease compared to children of mothers without autoimmune disease. In
conclusion, autoimmune disease in carrier mothers was not associated with the
presence of ASD in their children. However, seizures and tics were significantly 
increased in children of mothers with autoimmune disease. This suggests a
potential new mechanism of seizure and tic exacerbation in FXS related to an
intergenerational influence from autoimmunity in the carrier mother.

Fragile X: leading the way for targeted treatments in autism.

Two different mutations in the FMR1 gene may lead to autism. The full mutation,
with >200 CGG repeats in the 5' end of FMR1, leads to hypermethylation and
transcriptional silencing of FMR1, resulting in absence or deficiency of the
protein product, FMRP. Deficiency of FMRP in the brain causes fragile X syndrome 
(FXS). Autism occurs in approximately 30% of those with FXS, and pervasive
developmental disorders-not otherwise specified occur in an additional 30%. FMRP 
is an RNA binding protein that modulates receptor-mediated dendritic translation;
deficiency leads to dysregulation of many proteins important for synaptic
plasticity. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5) activated
translation is upregulated in FXS, and new targeted treatments that act on this
system include mGluR5 antagonists and GABA agonists, which may reverse the
cognitive and behavioral deficits in FXS. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is
one of the proteins elevated in FXS, and minocycline reduces excess MMP-9
activity in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of FXS. Both minocycline and mGluR5
antagonists are currently being evaluated in patients with FXS through controlled
treatment trials. The premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) may also contribute to the
mechanism of autism in approximately 10% of males and 2-3% of females.
Premutations with <150 repeats exert cellular effects through a different
molecular mechanism, one that involves elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA, CGG-mediated
toxicity to neurons, early cell death, and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia
syndrome. In those with large premutations (150-200), lowered levels of FMRP also
occur.

Evidence of reactive astrocytes but not peripheral immune system activation in a 
mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation 
and is one of the few known genetic causes of autism. FXS results from the loss
of Fmr1 gene function; thus, Fmr1 knockout mice provide a model to study
impairments associated with FXS and autism and to test potential therapeutic
interventions. The inhibitory serine phosphorylation of glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK3) is lower in brain regions of Fmr1 knockout mice than wild-type
mice and the GSK3 inhibitor lithium rescues several behavioral impairments in
Fmr1 knockout mice. Therefore, we examined if the serine phosphorylation of GSK3 
in Fmr1 knockout mice also was altered outside the brain and if administration of
lithium ameliorated the macroorchidism phenotype. Additionally, since GSK3
regulates numerous functions of the immune system and immune alterations have
been associated with autism, we tested if immune function is altered in Fmr1
knockout mice. The inhibitory serine phosphorylation of GSK3 was significantly
lower in the testis and liver of Fmr1 knockout mice than wild-type mice, and
chronic lithium treatment reduced macroorchidism in Fmr1 knockout mice. No
alterations in peripheral immune function were identified in Fmr1 knockout mice. 
However, examination of glia, the immune cells of the brain, revealed reactive
astrocytes in several brain regions of Fmr1 knockout mice and treatment with
lithium reduced this in the striatum and cerebellum. These results provide
further evidence of the involvement of dysregulated GSK3 in FXS, and demonstrate 
that lithium administration reduces macroorchidism and reactive astrocytes in
Fmr1 knockout mice.

Delayed stabilization of dendritic spines in fragile X mice.

California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) causes mental impairment and autism through
transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene, resulting in the loss of the
RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Cortical
pyramidal neurons in affected individuals and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice have an
increased density of dendritic spines. The mutant mice also show defects in
synaptic and experience-dependent circuit plasticity, which are known to be
mediated in part by dendritic spine dynamics. We used in vivo time-lapse imaging 
with two-photon microscopy through cranial windows in male and female neonatal
mice to test the hypothesis that dynamics of dendritic protrusions are altered in
KO mice during early postnatal development. We find that layer 2/3 neurons from
wild-type mice exhibit a rapid decrease in dendritic spine dynamics during the
first 2 postnatal weeks, as immature filopodia are replaced by mushroom spines.
In contrast, KO mice show a developmental delay in the downregulation of spine
turnover and in the transition from immature to mature spine subtypes. Blockade
of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling, which reverses some adult
phenotypes of KO mice, accentuated this immature protrusion phenotype in KO mice.
Thus, absence of FMRP delays spine stabilization and dysregulated mGluR signaling
in FXS may partially normalize this early synaptic defect.

Characterization and reversal of synaptic defects in the amygdala in a mouse
model of fragile X syndrome.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common inherited form of mental impairment and
autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Earlier studies have identified a role for aberrant
synaptic plasticity mediated by the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in 
FXS. However, many of these observations are derived primarily from studies in
the hippocampus. The strong emotional symptoms of FXS, on the other hand, are
likely to involve the amygdala. Unfortunately, little is known about how exactly 
FXS affects synaptic function in the amygdala. Here, using whole-cell recordings 
in brain slices from adult Fmr1 knockout mice, we find mGluR-dependent long-term 
potentiation to be impaired at thalamic inputs to principal neurons in the
lateral amygdala. Consistent with this long-term potentiation deficit, surface
expression of the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR1, is reduced in the lateral
amygdala of knockout mice. In addition to these postsynaptic deficits, lower
presynaptic release was manifested by a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous 
miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), increased paired-pulse
ratio, and slower use-dependent block of NMDA receptor currents. Strikingly,
pharmacological inactivation of mGluR5 with 2-methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine
(MPEP) fails to rescue either the deficit in long-term potentiation or surface
GluR1. However, the same acute MPEP treatment reverses the decrease in mEPSC
frequency, a finding of potential therapeutic relevance. Therefore, our results
suggest that synaptic defects in the amygdala of knockout mice are still amenable
to pharmacological interventions against mGluR5, albeit in a manner not
envisioned in the original hippocampal framework.

An assay for social interaction in Drosophila fragile X mutants.

We developed a novel assay to examine social interactions in Drosophila and, as a
first attempt, apply it here at examining the behavior of Drosophila Fragile X
Mental Retardation gene (dfmr1) mutants. Fragile X syndrome is the most common
cause of single gene intellectual disability (ID) and is frequently associated
with autism. Our results suggest that dfmr1 mutants are less active than
wild-type flies and interact with each other less often. In addition, mutants for
one allele of dfmr1, dfmr1(B55), are more likely to come in close contact with a 
wild-type fly than another dfmr1(B55) mutant. Our results raise the possibility
of defective social expression with preserved receptive abilities. We further
suggest that the assay may be applied in a general strategy of examining
endophenoypes of complex human neurological disorders in Drosophila, and
specifically in order to understand the genetic basis of social interaction
defects linked with ID.

Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.

As our understanding of the underlying defects in fragile X syndrome (FXS)
increases so does the potential for development of treatments aimed at modulating
the defects and ameliorating the constellation of symptoms seen in patients.
Symptoms of FXS include cognitive disability, hyperactivity, autistic behaviour, 
seizures and learning deficits. Lithium is a drug used clinically to treat
bipolar disorder, and it has been used to treat mood dysregulation in individuals
with FXS. We examined whether dietary lithium would alter behavioural and
morphological abnormalities in fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. We studied wild-type (WT)
and KO mice untreated (control chow) or treated with lithium (0.3%
lithium-carbonate-containing chow) commenced at weaning and maintained throughout
the experiment. At age 8-12 wk, mice were subjected to the following behavioural 
tests: open field, social interaction, elevated plus maze, elevated zero maze and
passive avoidance. At 13 wk, brains were prepared for Golgi staining and analysis
of dendritic spine morphology in medial prefrontal cortex. We found that compared
to untreated WT, untreated KO mice were hyperactive and had reduced anxiety,
impaired social interactions, and deficits on a learning test. Dendritic spines
in medial prefrontal cortex were longer and increased in number. Lithium
treatment ameliorated the hyperactivity and reversed impaired social interaction 
and deficits on the learning test. Lithium treatment also partially normalized
general anxiety levels and dendritic spine morphology. Our findings and those
from other laboratories on the efficacy of lithium treatment in animal models
support further studies in patients with FXS.

The diversity of protein isoforms arising from alternative splicing is thought to
modulate fine-tuning of synaptic plasticity. Fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP), a neuronal RNA binding protein, exists in isoforms as a result of
alternative splicing, but the contribution of these isoforms to neural plasticity
are not well understood. We show that two isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster
FMRP (dFMR1) have differential roles in mediating neural development and behavior
functions conferred by the dfmr1 gene. These isoforms differ in the presence of a
protein interaction module that is related to prion domains and is functionally
conserved between FMRPs. Expression of both isoforms is necessary for optimal
performance in tests of short- and long-term memory of courtship training. The
presence or absence of the protein interaction domain may govern the types of
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes dFMR1 assembles into, with different RNPs
regulating gene expression in a manner necessary for establishing distinct phases
of memory formation.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), resulting solely from the loss of function of the human
fragile X mental retardation 1 (hFMR1) gene, is the most common heritable cause
of mental retardation and autism disorders, with syndromic defects also in
non-neuronal tissues. In addition, the human genome encodes two closely related
hFMR1 paralogs: hFXR1 and hFXR2. The Drosophila genome, by contrast, encodes a
single dFMR1 gene with close sequence homology to all three human genes.
Drosophila that lack the dFMR1 gene (dfmr1 null mutants) recapitulate
FXS-associated molecular, cellular and behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that
FMR1 function has been conserved, albeit with specific functions possibly
sub-served by the expanded human gene family. To test evolutionary conservation, 
we used tissue-targeted transgenic expression of all three human genes in the
Drosophila disease model to investigate function at (1) molecular, (2) neuronal
and (3) non-neuronal levels. In neurons, dfmr1 null mutants exhibit elevated
protein levels that alter the central brain and neuromuscular junction (NMJ)
synaptic architecture, including an increase in synapse area, branching and
bouton numbers. Importantly, hFMR1 can, comparably to dFMR1, fully rescue both
the molecular and cellular defects in neurons, whereas hFXR1 and hFXR2 provide
absolutely no rescue. For non-neuronal requirements, we assayed male fecundity
and testes function. dfmr1 null mutants are effectively sterile owing to
disruption of the 9+2 microtubule organization in the sperm tail. Importantly,
all three human genes fully and equally rescue mutant fecundity and
spermatogenesis defects. These results indicate that FMR1 gene function is
evolutionarily conserved in neural mechanisms and cannot be compensated by either
FXR1 or FXR2, but that all three proteins can substitute for each other in
non-neuronal requirements. We conclude that FMR1 has a neural-specific function
that is distinct from its paralogs, and that the unique FMR1 function is
responsible for regulating neuronal protein expression and synaptic connectivity.

Longitudinal neuroimaging investigation of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most
common cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism, provides an
opportunity to study the influence of a specific genetic factor on
neurodevelopment in the living human brain. We examined voxel-wise gray and white
matter volumes (GMV, WMV) over a 2-year period in 1- to 3-year-old boys with FXS 
(n = 41) and compared these findings to age- and developmentally matched controls
(n = 28). We found enlarged GMV in the caudate, thalamus, and fusiform gyri and
reduced GMV in the cerebellar vermis in FXS at both timepoints, suggesting early,
possibly prenatal, genetically mediated alterations in neurodevelopment. In
contrast, regions in which initial GMV was similar, followed by an altered growth
trajectory leading to increased size in FXS, such as the orbital gyri, basal
forebrain, and thalamus, suggests delayed or otherwise disrupted synaptic pruning
occurring postnatally. WMV of striatal-prefrontal regions was greater in FXS
compared with controls, and group differences became more exaggerated over time, 
indicating the possibility that such WM abnormalities are the result of primary
FMRP-deficiency-related axonal pathology, as opposed to secondary connectional
dysregulation between morphologically atypical brain structures. Our results
indicate that structural abnormalities of different brain regions in FXS evolve
differently over time reflecting time-dependent effects of FMRP deficiency and
provide insight into their neuropathologic underpinnings. The creation of an
early and accurate human brain phenotype for FXS in humans will significantly
improve our capability to detect whether new disease-specific treatments can
"rescue" the FXS phenotype in affected individuals.

Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic form of mental retardation and 
autism, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in an RNA-binding protein,
Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Neurons from patients and the mouse 
Fmr1 knockout (KO) model are characterized by an excess of dendritic spines,
suggesting a deficit in excitatory synapse elimination. In response to neuronal
activity, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors induce robust
synapse elimination. Here, we demonstrate that MEF2 activation fails to eliminate
functional or structural excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons from Fmr1 KO 
mice. Similarly, inhibition of endogenous MEF2 increases synapse number in
wild-type but not Fmr1 KO neurons. MEF2-dependent synapse elimination is rescued 
in Fmr1 KO neurons by acute postsynaptic expression of wild-type but not
RNA-binding mutants of FMRP. Our results reveal that active MEF2 and FMRP
function together in an acute, cell-autonomous mechanism to eliminate excitatory 
synapses.

FMR1 gene expansion, large deletion of Xp, and skewed X-inactivation in a girl
with mental retardation and autism.

We describe a girl with mild facial anomalies, mild mental retardation, and
atypical autism with a remarkable behavioral phenotype of persistent anger,
aggression, and dysphoria. The occurrence of late-onset tremor and premature
ovarian failure in the maternal branch of the family pointed to a possible defect
in the FMR1 gene. Indeed, the patient carried a full FMR1 mutation. Unexpectedly,
both alleles of the gene were almost completely methylated. Cytogenetic
examination of the patient revealed in addition a large de novo deletion in band 
Xp22 on one of her X chromosomes. The deletion was fine mapped using
oligonucleotide array CGH, and its breakpoints were localized using sequencing.
The size of the deletion was about 17.4 Mb, and it contained more than 90
protein-coding genes. Microsatellite analysis indicated paternal origin of the
aberrant chromosome. The large rearrangement was the most probable cause of the
X-inactivation skewing, thus explaining the methylation of not only the expanded 
(maternal) but also the normal (paternal) FMR1 alleles. This pattern of skewed
X-inactivation was confirmed using the analysis of methylation at the AR locus.
The relatively mild phenotype of the patient resulted most likely from unmasking 
of the FMR1 defect. Although the deleted region contained many important genes,
the phenotypic contribution of the rearranged X chromosome was probably limited
by its almost complete inactivation. However, reduced dose of several genes
escaping X-inactivation might also play a role in the phenotype of the patient.

GSK3 influences social preference and anxiety-related behaviors during social
interaction in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome and autism.

BACKGROUND: Nearly 1% of children in the United States exhibit autism spectrum
disorders, but causes and treatments remain to be identified. Mice with deletion 
of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene are used to model autism
because loss of Fmr1 gene function causes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and many
people with FXS exhibit autistic-like behaviors. Glycogen synthase kinase-3
(GSK3) is hyperactive in brains of Fmr1 knockout mice, and inhibition of GSK3 by 
lithium administration ameliorates some behavioral impairment in these mice. We
extended our studies of this association by testing whether GSK3 contributes to
socialization behaviors. This used two mouse models with disrupted regulation of 
GSK3, Fmr1 knockout mice and GSK3 knockin mice, in which inhibitory serines of
the two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3alpha and GSK3beta, are mutated to alanines,
leaving GSK3 fully active.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To assess sociability, test mice were introduced 
to a restrained stimulus mouse (S1) for 10 min, followed by introduction of a
second restrained stimulus mouse (S2) for 10 min, which assesses social
preference. Fmr1 knockout and GSK3 knockin mice displayed no deficit in
sociability with the S1 mouse, but unlike wild-type mice neither demonstrated
social preference for the novel S2 mouse. Fmr1 knockout mice displayed more
anxiety-related behaviors during social interaction (grooming, rearing, and
digging) than wild-type mice, which was ameliorated by inhibition of GSK3 with
chronic lithium treatment.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that impaired inhibitory
regulation of GSK3 in Fmr1 knockout mice may contribute to some socialization
deficits and that lithium treatment can ameliorate certain socialization
impairments. As discussed in the present work, these results suggest a role for
GSK3 in social behaviors and implicate inhibition of GSK3 as a potential
therapeutic.

Alterations in sensory processing constitute prominent symptoms of fragile X
syndrome; however, little is known about how disrupted synaptic and circuit
development in sensory cortex contributes to these deficits. To investigate how
the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) impacts the development
of cortical synapses, we examined excitatory thalamocortical synapses in
somatosensory cortex during the perinatal critical period in Fmr1 knockout mice. 
FMRP ablation resulted in dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling maturation.
The fraction of silent synapses persisting to later developmental times was
increased; there was a temporal delay in the window for synaptic plasticity,
while other forms of developmental plasticity were not altered in Fmr1 knockout
mice. Our results indicate that FMRP is required for the normal developmental
progression of synaptic maturation, and loss of this important RNA binding
protein impacts the timing of the critical period for layer IV synaptic
plasticity.

Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation and
leading genetic cause of autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the
Fmr1 gene. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the gene product of
Fmr1, is an RNA binding protein that negatively regulates translation in neurons.
The Fmr1 knock-out mouse, a model of fragile X syndrome, exhibits cognitive
deficits and exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent
long-term depression at CA1 synapses. However, the molecular mechanisms that link
loss of function of FMRP to aberrant synaptic plasticity remain unclear. The
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade controls initiation of
cap-dependent translation and is under control of mGluRs. Here we show that mTOR 
phosphorylation and activity are elevated in hippocampus of juvenile Fmr1
knock-out mice by four functional readouts: (1) association of mTOR with
regulatory associated protein of mTOR; (2) mTOR kinase activity; (3)
phosphorylation of mTOR downstream targets S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein; and 
(4) formation of eukaryotic initiation factor complex 4F, a critical first step
in cap-dependent translation. Consistent with this, mGluR long-term depression at
CA1 synapses of FMRP-deficient mice is exaggerated and rapamycin insensitive. We 
further show that the p110 subunit of the upstream kinase phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) and its upstream activator PI3K enhancer PIKE, predicted targets 
of FMRP, are upregulated in knock-out mice. Elevated mTOR signaling may provide a
functional link between overactivation of group I mGluRs and aberrant synaptic
plasticity in the fragile X mouse, mechanisms relevant to impaired cognition in
fragile X syndrome.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by abnormal reciprocal
social interactions, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors with
restricted interests. BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) is an inbred mouse strain that shows
robust behavioral phenotypes with analogies to all three of the diagnostic
symptoms of autism, including well-replicated deficits in reciprocal social
interactions and social approach, unusual patterns of ultrasonic vocalization,
and high levels of repetitive self-grooming. These phenotypes offer
straightforward behavioral assays for translational investigations of
pharmacological compounds. Two suggested treatments for autism were evaluated in 
the BTBR mouse model. Methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP), an antagonist of
the mGluR5 metabotropic glutamate receptor, blocks aberrant phenotypes in the
Fmr1 mouse model of Fragile X, a comorbid neurodevelopmental disorder with
autistic features. Risperidone has been approved by the United States Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of irritability, tantrums, and
self-injurious behavior in autistic individuals. We evaluated the actions of MPEP
and risperidone on two BTBR phenotypes, low sociability and high repetitive
self-grooming. Open field activity served as an independent control for
non-social exploratory activity and motor functions. C57BL/6J (B6), an inbred
strain with high sociability and low self-grooming, served as the strain control.
MPEP significantly reduced repetitive self-grooming in BTBR, at doses that had no
sedating effects on open field activity. Risperidone reduced repetitive
self-grooming in BTBR, but only at doses that induced sedation in both strains.
No overall improvements in sociability were detected in BTBR after treatment with
either MPEP or risperidone. Our findings suggest that antagonists of mGluR5
receptors may have selective therapeutic efficacy in treating repetitive
behaviors in autism.

Research into the determinants and developmental course of fragile X syndrome
(FXS) has made remarkable progress over the last 25 years. However, treatments to
ameliorate the symptoms of FXS have been less forthcoming. While there is
optimism in the field that the pace of intervention research is quickening, there
has been a bias toward psychopharmacological approaches to treatment. A closer
look at the data from those investigations reveals a paucity of evidence that
medications can improve intellectual and adaptive functioning in FXS, or decrease
associated behavioral and/or emotional issues. Work in other related disorders
(e.g., autism) has shown that dramatic improvements in intellectual and adaptive 
functioning, as well as behavioral and emotional problems, can occur if intensive
behavioral treatment is begun early in the child's life. It is hoped that future 
research efforts will evaluate these intensive early intervention strategies in
children with FXS, perhaps in combination with pharmacological approaches.

The mental retardation, autistic features, and behavioral abnormalities
characteristic of the Fragile X mental retardation syndrome result from the loss 
of function of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. The disease is usually caused by a
triplet repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene. This leads to loss of
function through transcriptional gene silencing, pointing to a key function for
FMRP, but precluding genetic identification of critical activities within the
protein. Moreover, antisense transcripts (FMR4, ASFMR1) in the same locus have
been reported to be silenced by the repeat expansion. Missense mutations offer
one means of confirming a central role for FMRP in the disease, but to date, only
a single such patient has been described. This patient harbors an isoleucine to
asparagine mutation (I304N) in the second FMRP KH-type RNA-binding domain,
however, this single case report was complicated because the patient harbored a
superimposed familial liver disease. To address these issues, we have generated a
new Fragile X Syndrome mouse model in which the endogenous Fmr1 gene harbors the 
I304N mutation. These mice phenocopy the symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome in the
existing Fmr1-null mouse, as assessed by testicular size, behavioral phenotyping,
and electrophysiological assays of synaptic plasticity. I304N FMRP retains some
functions, but has specifically lost RNA binding and polyribosome association;
moreover, levels of the mutant protein are markedly reduced in the brain
specifically at a time when synapses are forming postnatally. These data suggest 
that loss of FMRP function, particularly in KH2-mediated RNA binding and in
synaptic plasticity, play critical roles in pathogenesis of the Fragile X
Syndrome and establish a new model for studying the disorder.

Broad clinical involvement in a family affected by the fragile X premutation.

The mutations in the FMR1 gene have been described as a family of disorders
called fragile X-associated disorders including fragile X syndrome, fragile
X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, and other
problems associated with the premutation, such as hypothyroidism, hypertension,
neuropathy, anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, and
autism spectrum disorders. The premutation is relatively common in the general
population affecting 1 of 130 to 250 female individuals and 1 of 250 to 800 male 
individuals. Therefore, to provide appropriate treatment and genetic counseling
for all of the carriers and affected individuals in a family, a detailed family
history that reviews many of the disorders that are related to both the
premutation and the full mutation should be carried out as exemplified in these
cases. To facilitate the integration of this knowledge into clinical practice,
this is the first case report that demonstrates only premutation involvement
across 3 generations.

Altered neuroligin expression is involved in social deficits in a mouse model of 
the fragile X syndrome.

Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3. rdahlhaus@hotmail.com

The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental
retardation. Caused by a transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental
retardation protein (FMRP), a mRNA binding protein itself, misregulated
translation is thought to be the leading cause of the fragile X syndrome.
Interestingly, recent results indicated several neuroligin interacting proteins
to be affected by this misregulation, including neurexin1 and PSD95, which have
also been implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Using co-immunoprecipitation
assays and RT-PCR, FMRP is shown to interact with neuroligin1- and 2-mRNA, while 
no interaction with neuroligin3-mRNA is observed. In line with FMRP's role in
translation regulation, Western blot as well as immunohistochemistry analysis
reveal changes in protein expression levels suggesting impaired synaptic
function. As increasing evidence indicates neuroligin expression to be critical
for synapse maturation and function, consequences of impaired neuroligin1
expression in FXS are assessed by overexpressing HA-neuroligin1 in FMR1-/- mice, 
a model for FXS. Behavioural assessments demonstrate that enhanced neuroligin1
expression improves social behaviour in FMR1-/- mice, whereas no positive effect 
on learning and memory is seen. These results provide for the first time evidence
for an involvement of a neuroligin-neurexin protein network in core symptoms of
FXS.

chain reaction technique.

BACKGROUND: Because fragile X syndrome (FXS) is prevalent, it has become the
subject of newborn and high-risk screening efforts. International screening,
however, can be financially and logistically prohibitive, particularly in
countries where resources may be scarce. Recently, we have developed a screening 
test on blood spot that can detect expanded alleles from the normal through the
full mutation range in both males and females. It is accurate, rapid,
inexpensive, and applicable on blood spots and therefore ideal for international 
screening. The use of this blood spot screening technique was piloted in "a
high-risk screening" study of individuals in Guatemala.
METHODS: One hundred and five blood spots from subjects from Guatemala were
screened for the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 mutation. They were classified as
"high-risk" through placement into one of the following five categories: (a)
relatives of someone with a previous FXS diagnosis, (b) individuals with
confirmed autism, (c) individuals with confirmed intellectual disability, (d)
individuals with Parkinson's-like presentation, and (e) individuals with a family
history of intellectual disability but no confirmed cases of FXS.
RESULTS: Fifteen of the individuals tested yielded an expanded allele, 10
premutations and 5 full mutations. All 15 expansions were found in individuals
with a relative with a confirmed FXS diagnosis. No expansions were found in the
other clinical groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood spot polymerase chain reaction screening is an effective,
cost-efficient method to conduct cascade testing in families with a known history
of FXS, even in small screening cohorts.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited mental retardation
and a genetic cause of autism, results from mutated fragile X mental
retardation-1 (Fmr1). This study examined the effects on glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK3) of treatment with a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)
antagonist, MPEP, and the GSK3 inhibitor, lithium, in C57Bl/6 Fmr1 knockout mice.
Increased mGluR signaling may contribute to the pathology of FXS, and the mGluR5 
antagonist MPEP increased inhibitory serine-phosphorylation of brain GSK3
selectively in Fmr1 knockout mice but not in wild-type mice. Inhibitory
serine-phosphorylation of GSK3 was lower in Fmr1 knockout, than wild-type, mouse 
brain regions and was increased by acute or chronic lithium treatment, which also
increased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Fmr1 knockout
mice displayed alterations in open-field activity, elevated plus-maze, and
passive avoidance, and these differences were ameliorated by chronic lithium
treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that impaired inhibition of GSK3
contributes to the pathogenesis of FXS and support GSK3 as a potential
therapeutic target.

Temporal requirements of the fragile x mental retardation protein in modulating
circadian clock circuit synaptic architecture.

Gatto CL(1), Broadie K.

(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Kennedy Center for Research on Human
Development, Vanderbilt University Nashville, TN, USA.

Loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene function is the most common
cause of inherited mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders,
characterized by attention disorder, hyperactivity and disruption of circadian
activity cycles. Pursuit of effective intervention strategies requires
determining when the FMR1 product (FMRP) is required in the regulation of
neuronal circuitry controlling these behaviors. In the well-characterized
Drosophila disease model, loss of the highly conserved dFMRP causes circadian
arrhythmicity and conspicuous abnormalities in the circadian clock circuitry.
Here, a novel Sholl Analysis was used to quantify over-elaborated synaptic
architecture in dfmr1-null small ventrolateral neurons (sLN(v)s), a key subset of
clock neurons. The transgenic Gene-Switch system was employed to drive
conditional neuronal dFMRP expression in the dfmr1-null mutant background in
order to dissect temporal requirements within the clock circuit. Introduction of 
dFMRP during early brain development, including the stages of neurogenesis,
neuronal fate specification and early pathfinding, provided no rescue of dfmr1
mutant phenotypes. Similarly, restoring normal dFMRP expression in the adult
failed to restore circadian circuit architecture. In sharp contrast, supplying
dFMRP during a transient window of very late brain development, wherein
synaptogenesis and substantial subsequent synaptic reorganization (e.g.
use-dependent pruning) occur, provided strong morphological rescue to reestablish
normal sLN(v)s synaptic arbors. We conclude that dFMRP plays a developmentally
restricted role in sculpting synaptic architecture in these neurons that cannot
be compensated for by later reintroduction of the protein at maturity.

Fragile X syndrome: from molecular genetics to therapy.

D'Hulst C(1), Kooy RF.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.

Fragile X syndrome, the main cause of inherited mental retardation, is caused by 
transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation gene, FMR1. Absence
of the associated protein FMRP leads to the dysregulation of many genes creating 
a phenotype of ADHD, anxiety, epilepsy and autism. The core aim of this review is
to summarise two decades of molecular research leading to the characterisation of
cellular and molecular pathways involved in the pathology of this disease and as 
a consequence to the identification of two new promising targets for rational
therapy of fragile X syndrome, namely the group 1 metabotrope glutamate receptors
(Gp1 mGluRs) and the gamma-amino butyric acid A receptors (GABA(A)Rs). As no
current clinical treatments are directed specifically at the underlying neuronal 
defect due to absence of FMRP, this might open new powerful therapeutic
strategies.

CGG repeat expansions in the 5' noncoding region of the fragile X mental
retardation 1 gene (FMR1) give rise to both neurodevelopmental and
neurodegenerative human diseases depending on the length of the expansion.
Expansions beyond 200 repeats (full mutation) generally result in gene silencing 
and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable form of cognitive impairment 
and autism. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; "premutation") give rise to
the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
(FXTAS) through an entirely distinct, toxic mRNA gain-of-function mechanism. A
rapid means for both high-risk and newborn screening for allele size would
provide a greater opportunity for early intervention and family counseling as
well as furnish critical data on repeat size distribution and expanded allele
frequencies. In the current work, we propose a novel mass spectrometry (MS) based
method for the rapid identification of expanded CGG repeats to complement a
recently described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for large population
screening. In this combined approach, the optimized PCR method is used to amplify
the relevant region of FMR1, followed by extensive nonspecific nuclease
digestion. The resulting oligonucleotides are analyzed by MS in a manner that
provides the relative proportion of triplet repeat oligonucleotides in seconds
per sample. This assay enables swift and reproducible detection of expanded CGG
alleles using a single blood spot and in principle is suitable for large scale
studies and newborn screening. Moreover, this analytical scheme establishes a
unique new intersection of MS with molecular biology, with potential for
significant interdisciplinary impact.

Autism is an umbrella diagnosis with several different etiologies. Fragile X
syndrome (FXS), one of the first identified and leading causes of autism, has
been modeled in mice using molecular genetic manipulation. These Fmr1 knockout
mice have recently been used to identify a new putative therapeutic target, the
metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), for the treatment of FXS. Moreover,
mGluR5 signaling cascades interact with a number of synaptic proteins, many of
which have been implicated in autism, raising the possibility that therapeutic
targets identified for FXS may have efficacy in treating multiple other causes of
autism.

The state of synapses in fragile X syndrome.

(1)Department of Neuroscience, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
Dallas, TX 75390-9011, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation 
and a leading genetic cause of autism. There is increasing evidence in both FXS
and other forms of autism that alterations in synapse number, structure, and
function are associated and contribute to these prevalent diseases. FXS is caused
by loss of function of the Fmr1 gene, which encodes the RNA binding protein,
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Therefore, FXS is a tractable model 
to understand synaptic dysfunction in cognitive disorders. FMRP is present at
synapses where it associates with mRNA and polyribosomes. Accumulating evidence
finds roles for FMRP in synapse development, elimination, and plasticity. Here,
the authors review the synaptic changes observed in FXS and try to relate these
changes to what is known about the molecular function of FMRP. Recent advances in
the understanding of the molecular and synaptic function of FMRP, as well as the 
consequences of its loss, have led to the development of novel therapeutic
strategies for FXS.

BACKGROUND: Significant advances in understanding brain development and behavior 
have not been accompanied by revisions of traditional academic structure.
Disciplinary isolation and a lack of meaningful interdisciplinary opportunities
are persistent barriers in academic medicine. To enhance clinical practice,
research, and training for the next generation, academic centers will need to
take bold steps that challenge traditional departmental boundaries. Such change
is not only desirable but, in fact, necessary to bring about a truly innovative
and more effective approach to treating disorders of the developing brain.
METHODS: I focus on developmental disorders as a convergence point for
transcending traditional academic boundaries. First, the current taxonomy of
developmental disorders is described with emphasis on how current diagnostic
systems inadvertently hinder research progress. Second, I describe the clinical
features of autism, a phenomenologically defined condition, and Rett and fragile 
X syndromes, neurogenetic diseases that are risk factors for autism. Finally, I
describe how the fields of psychiatry, psychology, neurology, and pediatrics now 
have an unprecedented opportunity to promote an interdisciplinary approach to
training, research, and clinical practice and, thus, advance a deeper
understanding of developmental disorders.
RESULTS: Research focused on autism is increasingly demonstrating the
heterogeneity of individuals diagnosed by DSM criteria. This heterogeneity
hinders the ability of investigators to replicate research results as well as
progress towards more effective, etiology-specific interventions. In contrast,
fragile X and Rett syndromes are 'real' diseases for which advances in research
are rapidly accelerating towards more disease-specific human treatment trials.
CONCLUSIONS: A major paradigm shift is required to improve our ability to
diagnose and treat individuals with developmental disorders. This paradigm shift 
must take place at all levels - training, research and clinical activity. As
clinicians and scientists who are currently constrained by disciplinary-specific 
history and training, we must move towards redefining ourselves as clinical
neuroscientists with shared interests and expertise that permit a more cohesive
and effective approach to improving the lives of patients.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is the most common form of familial mental
retardation, is caused by the expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene on the
X chromosome. Previous studies have suggested that as compared to other
populations, Japanese have a lower prevalence of FXS. In addition, in the normal 
population, there are no carriers who have the premutation allele. We analyzed a 
total of 946 normal Japanese (576 males and 370 females) and attempted to
estimate the frequency of the FMR1 allele. Within this population, we found that 
1,155 alleles were in the normal range (less than 40 CGG repeats) and had a modal
number of 27 repeats (35.75%). No carriers with premutations (55-200 CGG repeats)
were observed in this normal population. We also identified six
intermediate-sized alleles (40-54 CGG repeats), with a reported incidence of 1 in
103 males and 1 in 324 females. However, this allele frequency was different from
that previously reported for the Japanese population. Since data from previous
studies has suggested that FXS might possibly be associated with the genetic
mechanism of autism, we also analyzed the length of the CGG repeats in 109
autistic patients. In all cases the CGG repeat numbers were within the normal
range (16-36 repeats) and no individuals presented with expanded premutation or
intermediate alleles. This finding indicates that the length of the CGG repeat
within the FMR1 is unlikely to be responsible for autism in Japanese.

The FXG: a presynaptic fragile X granule expressed in a subset of developing
brain circuits.

The loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes Fragile X
syndrome, the most common inherited mental retardation and single gene cause of
autism. Although postsynaptic functions for FMRP are well established, potential 
roles at the presynaptic apparatus remain largely unexplored. Here, we
characterize the expression of FMRP and its homologs, FXR1P and FXR2P, in the
developing, mature and regenerating rodent nervous system, with a focus on
presynaptic expression. As expected, FMRP is expressed in the somatodendritic
domain in virtually all neurons. However, FMRP is also localized in discrete
granules (Fragile X granules; FXGs) in a subset of brain regions including
frontal cortex, hippocampal area CA3 and olfactory bulb glomeruli. Immunoelectron
microscopy shows that FMRP is localized at presynaptic terminals and in axons
within these FXG-rich regions. With the exception of the olfactory bulb, FXGs are
prominent only in the developing brain. Experiments in regenerating olfactory
circuits indicate that peak FXG expression occurs 2-4 weeks after neurogenesis, a
period that correlates with synapse formation and refinement. Virtually all FXGs 
contain FXR2P, while region-selective subsets harbor FMRP and/or FXR1P. Genetic
studies show that FXR2P is essential for FXG expression, while FMRP regulates FXG
number and developmental profile. These findings suggest that Fragile X proteins 
play a distinct, presynaptic role during discrete developmental epochs in defined
circuits of the mammalian CNS. We propose that the neurological defects in
Fragile X syndrome, including the autistic features, could be due in part to the 
loss of FMRP function in presynaptic compartments.

Fragile X syndrome, the most frequent form of inherited mental retardation, is
due to the absence of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding
protein involved in several steps of RNA metabolism. To date, two RNA motifs have
been found to mediate FMRP/RNA interaction, the G-quartet and the "kissing
complex," which both induce translational repression in the presence of FMRP. We 
show here a new role for FMRP as a positive modulator of translation. FMRP
specifically binds Superoxide Dismutase 1 (Sod1) mRNA with high affinity through 
a novel RNA motif, SoSLIP (Sod1 mRNA Stem Loops Interacting with FMRP), which is 
folded as three independent stem-loop structures. FMRP induces a structural
modification of the SoSLIP motif upon its interaction with it. SoSLIP also
behaves as a translational activator whose action is potentiated by the
interaction with FMRP. The absence of FMRP results in decreased expression of
Sod1. Because it has been observed that brain metabolism of FMR1 null mice is
more sensitive to oxidative stress, we propose that the deregulation of Sod1
expression may be at the basis of several traits of the physiopathology of the
Fragile X syndrome, such as anxiety, sleep troubles, and autism.

Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, which typically emerges in early 
childhood. Most cases of autism have not been linked to mutations in a specific
gene, and the etioloty of the disorder remains to be established [S.S. Moy, J.J. 
Nadler, T.R. Magnuson, J.N. Crawley, Mouse models of autism spectrum disorders:
the challenge for behavioral genetics, Am. J. Med. Genet. 142 (2006) 40-51].
Fragile X syndrome is caused by mutation in the FMR1 gene and is characterized by
mental retardation, physical abnormalities, and, in most case, autistic-like
behavior [R.J. Hagerman, A.W. Jackson, A. Levitas, B. Rimland, M. Braden, An
analysis of autism in fifty males with the Fragile X syndrome, Am. J. Med. Genet.

retardation, Cell 78 (1994) 23-33]. The FMR1 knockout (KO) mouse is one of the
best characterized animal models for human disorders associated with autism [S.S.
Moy, J.J. Nadler, T.R. Magnuson, J.N. Crawley, Mouse models of autism spectrum
disorders: the challenge for behavioral genetics, Am. J. Med. Genet. 142 (2006)
40-51]. We have used real-time PCR to investigate changes in expression levels of
three genes: WNT2, MECP2, and FMR1 in different brain regions of Fagile X mice
and litter mate controls. We found major changes in the expression pattern for
the three genes examined. FMR1, MECP2, and WNT2 expression were drastically down 
regulated in the Fragile X mouse brain.

Autism, which is common in individuals with fragile X syndrome, is often
difficult to diagnose. We compared the diagnostic classifications of two measures
for autism diagnosis, the ADOS and the ADI-R, in addition to the DSM-IV-TR in 63 
males with this syndrome. Overall, 30% of the subjects met criteria for autistic 
disorder and 30% met criteria for PDD-NOS. The classifications on the ADOS and
DSM-IV-TR were most similar, whereas the ADI-R classified subjects as autistic
much more frequently. We further investigated the relationship of both FMRP and
FMRI mRNA to symptoms of autism in this cohort and found no significant
relationship between the measures of autism and molecular features, including
FMRP, FMRI mRNA, and CGG repeat number.

The FMR1 mutations can cause a variety of disabilities, including cognitive
deficits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and other
socioemotional problems, in individuals with the full mutation form (fragile X
syndrome) and distinct difficulties, including primary ovarian insufficiency,
neuropathy and the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, in some older
premutation carriers. Therefore, multigenerational family involvement is commonly
encountered when a proband is identified with a FMR1 mutation. Studies of
metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 pathway antagonists in animal models of fragile
X syndrome have demonstrated benefits in reducing seizures, improving behavior,
and enhancing cognition. Trials of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists 
are beginning with individuals with fragile X syndrome. Targeted treatments,
medical and behavioral interventions, genetic counseling, and family supports are
reviewed here.

INTRODUCTION: Mental retardation has an approximated prevalence of 2% in the
general population and its most frequent cause is X-fragile syndrome. This
genetic disorder predominantly affects males and it is mainly caused by the
expansion of CGG in FMR1 gene. Recently has been demonstrated that mutations in a
new called ARX gene (aristaless-related homeobox) can also cause a similar form
of X linked mental retardation, as well as other neurological disorders (autism, 
Partington or West syndrome). The most frequent mutation that has been reported
is the c.428_451 dup24, which comprises almost 60% of all described. It causes an
expansion of a polyalanine tract of ARX protein.
CASE REPORTS: We report three cases of mental retardation in two different
families where the mutation in ARX gene c.428_451 dup24 was found while X-fragile
syndrome screening was made. Personal and familiar history, phenotype and
evolution are described.
CONCLUSION: The molecular analysis of this mutation should be considered as a
routine for the genetic diagnosis of mental retardation in males of nondrafted
cause.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) caused by the mutation of the FMR1 gene, is 
the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, autism, and other
psychoneurological disorders. Timely identification of young children with social
or emotional challenges is urged in that emotional and social problems are often 
overlooked until problems reach serious magnitudes. Reliable methods of screening
children at an earlier age are crucial to early intervention.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to illuminate phenotypic characteristics 
of FXS and the role that the use of screening tools may play to help
interdisciplinary health and human development professionals to empower parents
as frontline screeners to seek early diagnosis and implement effective early
intervention.
METHODS: This article reviews what is known about phenotypic characteristics of
the FMR1 gene mutation. In addition, eight screening tools in use to screen for
the FMR1 gene mutation are compared with the author-developed screening tool, the
Biopsychiosocial Screening Inventory for Fragile X Syndrome (BIPSSI-FX).
CONCLUSIONS: The BIPSSI-FX, a parent response tool, is a conduit by which the
primary caregivers may contribute to an earlier diagnosis. It is the only parent 
response tool, based on research evidence, designed to tap the wealth of
knowledge parents possess about subtle developmental characteristics of very
young children with FXS.

Profound impairment in social interaction is a core symptom of autism, a severe
neurodevelopmental disorder. Deficits can include a lack of interest in social
contact and low levels of approach and proximity to other children. In this
study, a three-chambered choice task was used to evaluate sociability and social 
novelty preference in five lines of mice with mutations in genes implicated in
autism spectrum disorders. Fmr1(tm1Cgr/Y)(Fmr1(-/y)) mice represent a model for
fragile X, a mental retardation syndrome that is partially comorbid with autism. 
We tested Fmr1(-/y)mice on two genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6J and FVB/N-129/OlaHsd
(FVB/129). Targeted disruption of Fmr1 resulted in low sociability on one
measure, but only when the mutation was expressed on FVB/129. Autism has been
associated with altered serotonin levels and polymorphisms in SLC6A4 (SERT), the 
serotonin transporter gene. Male mice with targeted disruption of Slc6a4
displayed significantly less sociability than wild-type controls. Mice with
conditional overexpression of Igf-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) offered a
model for brain overgrowth associated with autism. Igf-1 transgenic mice engaged 
in levels of social approach similar to wild-type controls. Targeted disruption
in other genes of interest, En2 (engrailed-2) and Dhcr7, was carried on genetic
backgrounds that showed low levels of exploration in the choice task, precluding 
meaningful interpretations of social behavior scores. Overall, results show that 
loss of Fmr1 or Slc6a4 gene function can lead to deficits in sociability.
Findings from the fragile X model suggest that the FVB/129 background confers
enhanced susceptibility to consequences of Fmr1 mutation on social approach.

Fragile X syndrome: loss of local mRNA regulation alters synaptic development and
function.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of cognitive deficiency in
humans and perhaps the best-understood single cause of autism. A trinucleotide
repeat expansion, inactivating the X-linked FMR1 gene, leads to the absence of
the fragile X mental retardation protein. FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein
that regulates the local translation of a subset of mRNAs at synapses in response
to activation of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and possibly other
receptors. In the absence of FMRP, excess and dysregulated mRNA translation leads
to altered synaptic function and loss of protein synthesis-dependent plasticity. 
Recent evidence indicates the role of FMRP in regulated mRNA transport in
dendrites. New studies also suggest a possible local function of FMRP in axons
that may be important for guidance, synaptic development, and formation of neural
circuits. The understanding of FMRP function at synapses has led to rationale
therapeutic approaches.

Quantitative proteomic analysis of primary neurons reveals diverse changes in
synaptic protein content in fmr1 knockout mice.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited form of mental retardation that is
caused, in the vast majority of cases, by the transcriptional silencing of a
single gene, fmr1. The encoded protein, FMRP, regulates mRNA translation in
neuronal dendrites, and it is thought that changes in translation-dependent forms
of synaptic plasticity lead to many symptoms of FXS. However, little is known
about the potentially extensive changes in synaptic protein content that
accompany loss of FMRP. Here, we describe the development of a high-throughput
quantitative proteomic method to identify differences in synaptic protein
expression between wild-type and fmr1-/- mouse cortical neurons. The method is
based on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), which
has been used to characterize differentially expressed proteins in dividing
cells, but not in terminally differentiated cells because of reduced labeling
efficiency. To address the issue of incomplete labeling, we developed a
mathematical method to normalize protein ratios relative to a reference based on 
the labeling efficiency. Using this approach, in conjunction with
multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), we identified >100
proteins that are up- or down-regulated. These proteins fall into a variety of
functional categories, including those regulating synaptic structure,
neurotransmission, dendritic mRNA transport, and several proteins implicated in
epilepsy and autism, two endophenotypes of FXS. These studies provide insights
into the potential origins of synaptic abnormalities in FXS and a demonstration
of a methodology that can be used to explore neuronal protein changes in
neurological disorders.

Imbalance of neocortical excitation and inhibition and altered UP states reflect

Despite the pronounced neurological deficits associated with mental retardation
and autism, it is unknown if altered neocortical circuit function occurs in these
prevalent disorders. Here we demonstrate specific alterations in local synaptic
connections, membrane excitability, and circuit activity of defined neuron types 
in sensory neocortex of the mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome-the Fmr1 knockout
(KO). Overall, these alterations result in hyperexcitability of neocortical
circuits in the Fmr1 KO. Specifically, we observe a substantial deficit in local 
excitatory drive ( approximately 50%) targeting fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory
neurons in layer 4 of somatosensory, barrel cortex. This persists until at least 
4 wk of age suggesting it may be permanent. In contrast, monosynaptic GABAergic
synaptic transmission was unaffected. Overall, these changes indicate that local 
feedback inhibition in neocortical layer 4 is severely impaired in the Fmr1 KO
mouse. An increase in the intrinsic membrane excitability of excitatory neurons
may further contribute to hyperexcitability of cortical networks. In support of
this idea, persistent neocortical circuit activity, or UP states, elicited by
thalamic stimulation was longer in duration in the Fmr1 KO mouse. In addition,
network inhibition during the UP state was less synchronous, including a 14%
decrease in synchrony in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz). These circuit
changes may be involved in sensory stimulus hypersensitivity, epilepsy, and
cognitive impairment associated with Fragile X and autism.

Temporal requirements of the fragile X mental retardation protein in the
regulation of synaptic structure.

Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FraX), caused by the loss-of-function of one gene (FMR1), is 
the most common inherited form of both mental retardation and autism spectrum
disorders. The FMR1 product (FMRP) is an mRNA-binding translation regulator that 
mediates activity-dependent control of synaptic structure and function. To
develop any FraX intervention strategy, it is essential to define when and where 
FMRP loss causes the manifestation of synaptic defects, and whether the
reintroduction of FMRP can restore normal synapse properties. In the Drosophila
FraX model, dFMRP loss causes neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse
over-elaboration (overgrowth, overbranching, excess synaptic boutons),
accumulation of development-arrested satellite boutons, and altered
neurotransmission. We used the Gene-Switch method to conditionally drive dFMRP
expression to define the spatiotemporal requirements in synaptic mechanisms.
Constitutive induction of targeted neuronal dFMRP at wild-type levels rescues all
synaptic architectural defects in Drosophila Fmr1 (dfmr1)-null mutants,
demonstrating a presynaptic requirement for synapse structuring. By contrast,
presynaptic dFMRP expression does not ameliorate functional neurotransmission
defects, indicating a postsynaptic dFMRP requirement. Strikingly, targeted early 
induction of dFMRP effects nearly complete rescue of synaptic structure defects, 
showing a primarily early-development role. In addition, acute dFMRP expression
at maturity partially alleviates dfmr1-null defects, although rescue is not as
complete as either early or constitutive dFMRP expression, showing a modest
capacity for late-stage structural plasticity. We conclude that dFMRP
predominantly acts early in synaptogenesis to modulate architecture, but that
late dFMRP introduction at maturity can weakly compensate for early absence of
dFMRP function.

Parents enrolling in a national survey of families of children with fragile X
(FX) reported whether each of their children had been diagnosed or treated for
developmental delay or eight conditions frequently associated with FX: attention 
problems, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, self-injury, autism, seizures, anxiety, 
or depression. This article reports results for 976 full mutation males, 259 full
mutation females, 57 premutation males, and 199 premutation females. Co-occurring
conditions were frequently reported for all FMR1 gene variations. The number of
co-occurring conditions experienced was strongly associated with parent reports
of their child's ability to learn, adaptability, and quality of life. Most
individuals with the full mutation experienced multiple co-occurring conditions, 
with a modal number of 4 for males and 2 for females. Most (>80%) full mutation
males and females had been diagnosed or treated for attention problems.
Premutation males, when compared with a matched group of non-FX males, were more 
likely to have been diagnosed or treated for developmental delay, attention
problems, aggression, seizures, autism, and anxiety. Premutation females were
more likely to have been diagnosed or treated for attention problems, anxiety,
depression, and developmental delay. Clusters of conditions were identified,
seeming to occur in an additive fashion. Self-injury, autism, and seizures rarely
occurred in isolation, but were more likely in individuals who also had problems 
with attention, anxiety, and hyperactivity. The findings provide a reference
point for future studies on the prevalence and nature of co-occurring conditions 
in FX; suggest the possibility that certain conditions cluster together; provide 
evidence that male and female carriers experience elevated rates of co-occurring 
conditions compared with matched groups of non-carrier children; and emphasize
the importance of including an assessment of co-occurring conditions in any
clinical evaluation of individuals with abnormal variation in the FMR1 gene.

Parkinsonism in FMR1 premutation carriers may be indistinguishable from Parkinson
disease.

Premutation carriers of repeat expansions in the fragile X mental retardation
(FMR1) gene develop kinetic tremor and ataxia or the 'fragile X associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome' (FXTAS). Affected FMR1 premutation carriers also have
parkinsonism, but have not been reported to meet criteria for Parkinson disease. 
This case series illustrates that some patients who are FMR1 premutation carriers
may appear by history and examination to have idiopathic Parkinson disease. Based
on previous studies, it is likely that the genetic mutation and parkinsonism are 
associated. Although screening all PD patients is likely to be low yield, genetic
testing of FMR1 in individuals with PD and a family history of fragile X
syndrome, autism or developmental delay, or other related FMR1 phenotypes is
warranted.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the recent literature on fragile X and the genotypic
and phenotypic implications on human reproduction.
RECENT FINDINGS: Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental 
retardation and the most common genetic cause of autism. The fully expanded form 
of the mutation leads to mental retardation and autism, whereas the premutation
can lead to a neurological disorder called fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia,
macroorchidism after puberty and premature ovarian failure. Fragile X is also a
major cause of premature ovarian failure and irregular menses, and it can
subsequently affect fertility. Couples who carry the premutation or full mutation
should be offered genetic and preconceptual counseling prior to attempting to
conceive. This allows the patient full disclosure about the risks of transmitting
the mutation and possible preventive measures, which allows them to formulate
educated decisions about their reproductive future.
SUMMARY: Clinicians should identify and recognize clinical situations that
warrant fragile X testing to properly counsel and inform patients about their
reproductive possibilities and ways to increase their chances of a successful
reproductive outcome.

Comments on the article by C. H. McNaughton et al.. Individuals with fragile X
syndrome (FXS) show varying degrees of social behavior disturbances, from social 
anxiety to autism. This variability of social behavior phenotypes in FXS is
likely to be due to interactions of Fmr1 with other gene variants and
environmental factors during brain development, although very little is known
about the specific genetic and neural mechanisms involved. The Fmr1 knockout
mouse is an important experimental resource for elucidating the neural mechanisms
of social anxiety, social reward, and social cognition. However, studies of
social behavior phenotypes in the Fmr1 knockout mouse are still in early stages. 
McNaughton et al provide important new information on these phenotypes in the
Fmr1 knockout mouse through their use of novel, detailed behavioral analysis to
identify signs of increased social anxiety and social cognition deficits. Their
significant refinements in measurement of social behavior phenotypes will help to
advance future efforts to elucidate the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying 
social behavior disturbances in FXS and autism.

This study assessed social behavior in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS),
the Fmr1 (tm1Cgr) or Fmr1 "knockout" (KO) mouse. Both the KO and wild-type (WT)
mice preferred to be near a novel conspecific than to be alone. However, during
the initial interaction with a novel conspecific, (1) a greater proportion of the
KO mice exhibited high levels of grooming; and (2) the average duration of nose
contact with the stimulus mouse was significantly shorter for the KO mice, both
indicative of increased arousal and/or anxiety. Both groups exhibited a robust
novelty preference when the novel animal was a "preferred" mouse. However, when
the novel mouse was a "nonpreferred" animal, both groups showed a diminished
novelty preference but this effect was more pronounced for the WT mice. This
blunted negative reaction of the KO mice to a nonpreferred animal may indicate
that they were less proficient than controls in distinguishing between positive
and negative social interactions. These findings provide support for the use of
this animal model to study the autistic features of FXS and autism spectrum
disorders.

Fragile X syndrome, an X-linked dominant disorder with reduced penetrance, is
associated with intellectual and emotional disabilities ranging from learning
problems to mental retardation, and mood instability to autism. It is most often 
caused by the transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene, due to an expansion of 
a CGG repeat found in the 5'-untranslated region. The FMR1 gene product, FMRP, is
a selective RNA-binding protein that negatively regulates local protein synthesis
in neuronal dendrites. In its absence, the transcripts normally regulated by FMRP
are over translated. The resulting over abundance of certain proteins results in 
reduced synaptic strength due to AMPA receptor trafficking abnormalities that
lead, at least in part, to the fragile X phenotype.

Drosophila fragile X mental retardation protein developmentally regulates
activity-dependent axon pruning.

Tessier CR(1), Broadie K.

Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.

Fragile X Syndrome (FraX) is a broad-spectrum neurological disorder with symptoms
ranging from hyperexcitability to mental retardation and autism. Loss of the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene product, the mRNA-binding
translational regulator FMRP, causes structural over-elaboration of dendritic and
axonal processes, as well as functional alterations in synaptic plasticity at
maturity. It is unclear, however, whether FraX is primarily a disease of
development, a disease of plasticity or both: a distinction that is vital for
engineering intervention strategies. To address this crucial issue, we have used 
the Drosophila FraX model to investigate the developmental function of Drosophila
FMRP (dFMRP). dFMRP expression and regulation of chickadee/profilin coincides
with a transient window of late brain development. During this time, dFMRP is
positively regulated by sensory input activity, and is required to limit axon
growth and for efficient activity-dependent pruning of axon branches in the
Mushroom Body learning/memory center. These results demonstrate that dFMRP has a 
primary role in activity-dependent neural circuit refinement during late brain
development.

Impact of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene premutation on
neuropsychiatric functioning in adult males without fragile X-associated
Tremor/Ataxia syndrome: a controlled study.

Fragile X Syndrome is the most common heritable form of mental retardation caused
by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which arises from intergenerational trinucleotide 
repeat expansion leading to full mutation. An intermediary carrier condition,
known as the premutation, is characterized by expansion up to 200 repeats without
concomitant gene silencing. This prevalent allelic variant was initially thought 
to be free of phenotypic effects. However, recent reports have identified a
degenerative disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) in
older men as well as premature ovarian failure in women. Previously reports are
inconsistent regarding the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with premutation
due to small sample sizes, ascertainment bias, lack of adequate control groups,
administration of measures with poor psychometric properties, and the confounding
effects of FXTAS. We addressed these problems by conducting a controlled study of
male carriers (n = 40) of the premutation without manifest symptoms of FXTAS,
comparing their responses on specific, reliable, and valid measures of
neuropsychiatric functioning to those of individuals with shared family
environment (n = 22) and non-carrier comparison males (n = 43). Multivariate
analyses revealed that the premutation confers significant risk for working
memory difficulties, an associated feature of Attention-Deficit Disorder.
Furthermore, both the family controls and men with premutation exhibited higher
rates of Alcohol Abuse as compared to non-carrier control men. These findings
highlight the importance of recognizing the distinct phenotypic outcomes that
characterize the Fragile X premutation and the subtle risk factors that can act
as precursors to more significant psychiatric impairment.

Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of intellectual impairment
and the most common single gene associated with autism, generally occurs for
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) alleles that exceed 200 CGG repeats
(full-mutation range). Currently, there are no unbiased estimates of the number
of full-mutation FMR1 alleles in the general population; a major obstacle is the 
lack of an effective screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles in large
populations. We have developed a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles. The method utilizes a chimeric PCR
primer that targets randomly within the expanded CGG region, such that the
presence of a broad distribution of PCR products represents a positive result for
an expanded allele. The method is applicable for screening both males and females
and for allele sizes throughout the premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) and
full-mutation ranges. Furthermore, the method is capable of rapid detection of
expanded alleles using as little as 1% of the DNA from a single dried blood spot.
The methodology presented in this work is suitable for screening large
populations of newborn or those at high risk (eg, autism, premature ovarian
failure, ataxia, dementia) for expanded FMR1 alleles. The test described herein
costs less than $5 per sample for materials; with suitable scale-up and
automation, the cost should approach $1 per sample.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of heritable mental retardation 
and the leading identified cause of autism. FXS is caused by transcriptional
silencing of the FMR1 gene that encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein 
(FMRP), but the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. According to one
proposal, many psychiatric and neurological symptoms of FXS result from unchecked
activation of mGluR5, a metabotropic glutamate receptor. To test this idea we
generated Fmr1 mutant mice with a 50% reduction in mGluR5 expression and studied 
a range of phenotypes with relevance to the human disorder. Our results
demonstrate that mGluR5 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the
disease, a finding that has significant therapeutic implications for fragile X
and related developmental disorders.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently
described, underrecognized neurodegenerative disorder of aging fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation carriers, particularly men. Core motor features 
are action tremor, gait ataxia, and parkinsonism. Carriers have expanded CGG
repeats (55 to 200); larger expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most common 
heritable cause of mental retardation and autism. This study determines whether
CGG repeat length correlates with severity and type of motor dysfunction in
premutation carriers.
METHODS: Persons aged >or=50 years with a family history of fragile X syndrome
underwent structured videotaping. Movement disorder neurologists, blinded to
carrier status, scored the tapes using modified standardized rating scales. CGG
repeat length analyses for women incorporated the activation ratio, which
measures the percentage of normal active chromosome X alleles.
RESULTS: Male carriers (n = 54) had significantly worse total motor scores,
especially in tremor and ataxia, than age-matched male noncarriers (n = 51).
There was a trend toward a difference between women carriers (n = 82) and
noncarriers (n = 39). In men, increasing CGG repeat correlated with greater
impairment in all motor signs. In women, when activation ratio was considered,
increasing CGG correlated with greater ataxia.
CONCLUSIONS: CGG repeat size is significantly associated with overall motor
impairment in premutation carriers. Whereas this association is most pronounced
for men and covers overall motor impairment-tremor, ataxia, and parkinsonism-the 
association exists for ataxia among women carriers. This is the first report of a
significant correlation between the premutation status and a motor feature of
fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome in women.

Neural developmental disorders, such as autism, Rett Syndrome, Fragile X
syndrome, and Angelman syndrome manifest during early postnatal neural
development. Although the genes responsible for some of these disorders have been
identified, how the mutations of these genes affect neural development is
currently unclear. Emerging evidence suggest that these disorders share common
underlying defects in neuronal morphology, synaptic connectivity and brain
plasticity. In particular, alterations in dendritic branching and spine
morphology play a central role in the pathophysiology of most mental retardation 
disorders, suggesting that common pathways regulating neuronal function may be
affected. Epigenetic modulations, mediated by DNA methylation, RNA-associated
silencing, and histone modification, can serve as an intermediate process that
imprints dynamic environmental experiences on the "fixed" genome, resulting in
stable alterations in phenotypes. Disturbance in epigenetic regulations can lead 
to inappropriate expression or silencing of genes, causing an array of
multi-system disorders and neoplasias. Rett syndrome, the most common form of
mental retardation in young girls, is due to l mutation of MECP2, encoding a
methylated DNA binding protein that translates DNA methylation into gene
repression. Angelman syndrome is due to faulty genomic imprinting or maternal
mutations in UBE3A. Fragile X Syndrome, in most cases, results from the
hypermethylation of FMR1 promoter, hence the loss of expression of functional
FMRP protein. Autism, with its complex etiology, may have strong epigenetic link.
Together, these observations strongly suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play
a critical role in brain development and etiology of related disorders. This
report summarizes the scientific discussions and major conclusions from a recent 
conference that aimed to gain insight into the common molecular pathways affected
among these disorders and discover potential therapeutic targets that have been
missed by looking at one disorder at a time.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how neuroanatomic variation in children and adolescents
with fragile X syndrome is linked to reduced levels of the fragile X mental
retardation-1 protein and to aberrant cognition and behavior.
METHODS: This study included 84 children and adolescents with the fragile X full 
mutation and 72 typically developing control subjects matched for age and sex.
Brain morphology was assessed with volumetric, voxel-based, and surface-based
modeling approaches. Intelligence quotient was evaluated with standard cognitive 
testing, whereas abnormal behaviors were measured with the Autism Behavior
Checklist and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist.
RESULTS: Significantly increased size of the caudate nucleus and decreased size
of the posterior cerebellar vermis, amygdala, and superior temporal gyrus were
present in the fragile X group. Subjects with fragile X also demonstrated an
abnormal profile of cortical lobe volumes. A receiver operating characteristic
analysis identified the combination of a large caudate with small posterior
cerebellar vermis, amygdala, and superior temporal gyrus as distinguishing
children with fragile X from control subjects with a high level of sensitivity
and specificity. Large caudate and small posterior cerebellar vermis were
associated with lower fragile X mental retardation protein levels and more
pronounced cognitive deficits and aberrant behaviors.
INTERPRETATION: Abnormal development of specific brain regions characterizes a
neuroanatomic phenotype associated with fragile X syndrome and may mediate the
effects of FMR1 gene mutations on the cognitive and behavioral features of the
disorder. Fragile X syndrome provides a model for elucidating critical linkages
among gene, brain, and cognition in children with serious neurodevelopmental
disorders.

Fragile X syndrome (FX), the most common heritable cause of mental retardation
and autism, is a developmental disorder characterized by physical, cognitive, and
behavioral deficits. FX results from a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the
fmr1 gene that reduces levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).
Although research efforts have focused on FMRP's impact on mGluR signaling, how
the loss of FMRP leads to the individual symptoms of FX is not known. Previous
studies on human FX blood cells revealed alterations in the cyclic adenosine 3', 
5'-monophosphate (cAMP) cascade. We tested the hypothesis that cAMP signaling is 
altered in the FX nervous system using three different model systems. Induced
levels of cAMP in platelets and in brains of fmr1 knockout mice are substantially
reduced. Cyclic AMP induction is also significantly reduced in human FX neural
cells. Furthermore, cAMP production is decreased in the heads of FX Drosophila
and this defect can be rescued by reintroduction of the dfmr gene. Our results
indicate that a robust defect in cAMP production in FX is conserved across
species and suggest that cAMP metabolism may serve as a useful biomarker in the
human disease population. Reduced cAMP induction has implications for the
underlying causes of FX and autism spectrum disorders. Pharmacological agents
known to modulate the cAMP cascade may be therapeutic in FX patients and can be
tested in these models, thus supplementing current efforts centered on mGluR
signaling.

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of autistic spectrum
disorder (ASD) and identify its clinical characterization, and medical conditions
in a paediatric population in Portugal. A school survey was conducted in
elementary schools, targeting 332,808 school-aged children in the mainland and
10,910 in the Azores islands. Referred children were directly assessed using the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn), the Autism
Diagnostic Interview-Revised, and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Clinical
history and a laboratory investigation was performed. In parallel, a systematic
multi-source search of children known to have autism was carried out in a
restricted region. The global prevalence of ASD per 10,000 was 9.2 in mainland,
and 15.6 in the Azores, with intriguing regional differences. A diversity of
associated medical conditions was documented in 20%, with an unexpectedly high
rate of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental syndrome with markedly high heritability. The
diagnostic indicators of autism are core behavioral symptoms, rather than
definitive neuropathological markers. Etiology is thought to involve complex,
multigenic interactions and possible environmental contributions. In this review,
we focus on genetic pathways with multiple members represented in autism
candidate gene lists. Many of these pathways can also be impinged upon by
environmental risk factors associated with the disorder. The mouse model system
provides a method to experimentally manipulate candidate genes for autism
susceptibility, and to use environmental challenges to drive aberrant gene
expression and cell pathology early in development. Mouse models for fragile X
syndrome, Rett syndrome and other disorders associated with autistic-like
behavior have elucidated neuropathology that might underlie the autism phenotype,
including abnormalities in synaptic plasticity. Mouse models have also been used 
to investigate the effects of alterations in signaling pathways on neuronal
migration, neurotransmission and brain anatomy, relevant to findings in autistic 
populations. Advances have included the evaluation of mouse models with
behavioral assays designed to reflect disease symptoms, including impaired social
interaction, communication deficits and repetitive behaviors, and the symptom
onset during the neonatal period. Research focusing on the effect of gene-by-gene
interactions or genetic susceptibility to detrimental environmental challenges
may further understanding of the complex etiology for autism.

BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset
neurodegenerative disorder occurring in male and rare female carriers of a
premutation expansion (55 to 200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation
1 (FMR1) gene.
METHODS: Volumetric MRI studies, clinical staging, cognitive testing, and
molecular analysis were conducted in 15 female premutation carriers affected by
FXTAS (age 59.5 +/- 10.3 years), 20 unaffected female carriers (43.3 +/- 11.2
years), 11 genetically normal female controls (51.0 +/- 10.3 years), 36 affected 
male carriers (65.0 +/- 5.6 years), 25 unaffected male carriers (53.5 +/- 12.5
years), and 39 male controls (58.0 +/- 15.0 years). Female and male carriers with
FXTAS were matched on duration of disease.
RESULTS: We found less pronounced reductions of cerebellar volume and a lower
incidence of involvement (symmetric high T2 signal) of the middle cerebellar
peduncles (MCP sign) in females affected by FXTAS (13%) compared with affected
males (58%). We found reduced brain volumes and increased white matter disease
associated with the presence of FXTAS in females compared with female controls.
We also observed significant associations between reduced cerebellar volume and
both increased severity of FXTAS symptoms and increased length of the CGG repeat 
expansion in male premutation carriers, but not in females.
CONCLUSIONS: Females affected by fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
(FXTAS) demonstrated milder brain changes than affected males, although they
showed a similar pattern of radiologic findings consistent with brain atrophy and
white matter disease. FXTAS should be considered (by ordering fragile X DNA
testing) in females who present with late-onset ataxia, action tremor, or
neuropathy, particularly in those with a family history of mental retardation,
autism, or premature ovarian failure.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most commonly inherited form of mental retardation 
and autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental
retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and consequent loss of the fragile X mental retardation
protein. Despite growing evidence suggesting a role of specific receptors and
biochemical pathways in FXS pathogenesis, an effective therapeutic method has not
been developed. Here, we report that abnormalities in FMR1 knockout (KO) mice, an
animal model of FXS, are ameliorated, at least partially, at both cellular and
behavioral levels, by an inhibition of the catalytic activity of p21-activated
kinase (PAK), a kinase known to play a critical role in actin polymerization and 
dendritic spine morphogenesis. Greater spine density and elongated spines in the 
cortex, morphological synaptic abnormalities commonly observed in FXS, are at
least partially restored by postnatal expression of a dominant negative (dn) PAK 
transgene in the forebrain. Likewise, the deficit in cortical long-term
potentiation observed in FMR1 KO mice is fully restored by the dnPAK transgene.
Several behavioral abnormalities associated with FMR1 KO mice, including those in
locomotor activity, stereotypy, anxiety, and trace fear conditioning are also
ameliorated, partially or fully, by the dnPAK transgene. Finally, we demonstrate 
a direct interaction between PAK and fragile X mental retardation protein in
vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate the genetic rescue of phenotypes in a FXS
mouse model and suggest that the PAK signaling pathway, including the catalytic
activity of PAK, is a novel intervention site for development of an FXS and
autism therapy.

and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-5975, USA.

Fragile X syndrome (FraX) is the most common known cause of inherited mental
impairment. FMR1 gene mutations, the cause of FraX, lead to reduced expression of
FMR1 protein and an increased risk for a particular profile of cognitive,
behavioral, and emotional dysfunction. The study of individuals with FraX
provides a unique window of understanding into important disorders such as
autism, social phobia, cognitive disability, and depression. This review
highlights the typical phenotypic features of individuals with FraX, discussing
the apparent strengths and weaknesses in intellectual functioning, as evidenced
from longitudinal follow-up studies. It also discusses recent neuroanatomic
findings that may pave the way for more focused disease-specific pharmacologic
and behavioral interventions. This article describes the results of recent
medication trials designed to target symptoms associated with FraX. It also
describes some recent behavioral interventions that were conducted in our
laboratory.

Autism is a heterogeneous condition that is likely to result from the combined
effects of multiple genetic factors interacting with environmental factors. Given
its complexity, the study of autism associated with Mendelian single gene
disorders or known chromosomal etiologies provides an important perspective. We
used microarray analysis to compare the mRNA expression profile in lymphoblastoid
cells from males with autism due to a fragile X mutation (FMR1-FM), or a
15q11-q13 duplication (dup(15q)), and non-autistic controls. Gene expression
profiles clearly distinguished autism from controls and separated individuals
with autism based on their genetic etiology. We identified 68 genes that were
dysregulated in common between autism with FMR1-FM and dup(15q). We also
identified a potential molecular link between FMR1-FM and dup(15q), the
cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which was up-regulated in
dup(15q) patients. We were able to confirm this link in vitro by showing common
regulation of two other dysregulated genes, JAKMIP1 and GPR155, downstream of
FMR1 or CYFIP1. We also confirmed the reduction of the Jakmip1 protein in Fmr1
knock-out mice, demonstrating in vivo relevance. Finally, we showed independent
confirmation of roles for JAKMIP1 and GPR155 in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) 
by showing their differential expression in male sib pairs discordant for
idiopathic ASD. These results provide evidence that blood derived lymphoblastoid 
cells gene expression is likely to be useful for identifying etiological subsets 
of autism and exploring its pathophysiology.

The Prader-Willi phenotype (PWP) of fragile X syndrome (FXS) is associated with
obesity and hyperphagia similar to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), but without
cytogenetic or methylation abnormalities at 15q11-13. Thirteen cases of PWP and
FXS are reported here that were identified by obesity and hyperphagia. Delayed
puberty was seen in 5 of 9 cases who had entered puberty, a small penis or
testicles in seven of 13 cases, and infant hypotonia and/or a poor suck in seven 
of 13 cases. Autism spectrum disorder occurred in 10 of 13 cases, and autism was 
diagnosed in seven of 13 cases. We investigated cytoplasmic interacting FMR1
protein (CYFIP) expression, which is a protein that interacts with FMR1 protein
(FMRP) because the gene for CYFIP is located at 15q11-13. CYFIP mRNA levels were 
significantly reduced in our patients with the PWP and FXS compared to
individuals without FXS (p < .001) and also individuals with FXS without PWP (p =
.03).

Fragile X mental retardation protein induces synapse loss through acute
postsynaptic translational regulation.

Pfeiffer BE(1), Huber KM.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Basic Neuroscience, Department of Physiology, University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390, USA.

Fragile X syndrome, as well as other forms of mental retardation and autism, is
associated with altered dendritic spine number and structure. Fragile X syndrome 
is caused by loss-of-function mutations in Fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that regulates protein synthesis in vivo. It is
unknown whether FMRP plays a direct, cell-autonomous role in regulation of
synapse number, function, or maturation. Here, we report that acute postsynaptic 
expression of FMRP in Fmr1 knock-out (KO) neurons results in a decrease in the
number of functional and structural synapses without an effect on their synaptic 
strength or maturational state. Similarly, neurons endogenously expressing FMRP
(wild-type) have fewer synapses than neighboring Fmr1 KO neurons. An intact K
homology domain 2 (KH2) RNA-binding domain and dephosphorylation of FMRP at S500 
were required for the effects of FMRP on synapse number, indicating that FMRP
interaction with RNA and translating polyribosomes leads to synapse loss.

Although fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single gene disorder with a well-described
phenotype, it is not known why some individuals develop more significant
maladaptive behaviors such as aggression or autistic symptoms. Here, we studied
two candidate genes known to affect mood and aggression, the serotonin
transporter (5-HTTLPR) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA-VNTR) polymorphisms, in 50
males with FXS ages 8-24 years. Mothers and fathers of participants reported the 
frequency and severity of aggressive/destructive, self-injurious, and stereotypic
behaviors. Polymorphism genotypes were unrelated to age and IQ. Results showed a 
significant effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype on aggressive/destructive and stereotypic
behavior; males with FXS who were homozygous for the high-transcribing long (L/L)
genotype had the most aggressive and destructive behavior, and individuals
homozygous for the short (S/S) genotype had the least aggression. Those with the 
L/L genotype also had the highest levels of stereotypic behavior. There was no
effect of MAOA-VNTR on behavior; however those with the high-activity, 4-repeat
genotype were more likely to be taking SSRI or SNRI medication. This preliminary 
study prompts consideration of secondary genes that may modify behavioral
phenotype expression in neurodevelopmental disorders, even those with a single
gene etiology such as FXS.

Past autism research has often been dedicated to tracing the causes of the
disorder to a localized neurological abnormality, a single functional network, or
a single cognitive-behavioral domain. In this review, I argue that autism is a
"distributed disorder" on various levels of study (genetic, neuroanatomical,
neurofunctional, behavioral). "Localizing" models are therefore not promising.
The large array of potential genetic risk factors suggests that multiple (or all)
emerging functional brain networks are affected during early development. This is
supported by widespread growth abnormalities throughout the brain. Interactions
during development between affected functional networks and atypical experiential
effects (associated with atypical behavior) in children with autism further
complicate the neurological bases of the disorder, resulting in an "exponentially
distributed" profile. Promising approaches to a better characterization of neural
endophenotypes in autism are provided by techniques investigating white matter
and connectivity, such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), and
functional connectivity MRI. According to a recent hypothesis, the autistic brain
is generally characterized by "underconnectivity." However, not all findings are 
consistent with this view. The concepts and methodology of functional
connectivity need to be refined and results need to be corroborated by anatomical
studies (such as DTI tractography) before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Attentional dysfunction, impulsivity, and resistance to change in a mouse model
of fragile X syndrome.

On a series of attention tasks, male mice with a mutation targeted to the fragile
X mental retardation 1 (Fmrl) gene (Fmrl knockout [KO] mice) committed a higher
rate of premature responses than wild-type littermates, with the largest
differences seen when task contingencies changed. This finding indicates impaired
inhibitory control, particularly during times of stress or arousal. The KO mice
also committed a higher rate of inaccurate responses than controls, particularly 
during the final third of each daily test session, indicating impaired sustained 
attention. In the selective attention task, the unpredictable presentation of
potent olfactory distractors produced a generalized disruption in the performance
of the KO mice, whereas for controls, the disruption produced by the distractors 
was temporally limited. Finally, the attentional disruption seen following an
error was more pronounced for the KO mice than for controls, further implicating 
impaired regulation of arousal and/or negative affect. The present study provides
the first evidence that the Fmrl KO mouse is impaired in inhibitory control,
attention, and arousal regulation, hallmark areas of dysfunction in fragile X
syndrome. The resistance to change also seen in these mice provides a behavioral 
index for studying the autistic features of this disorder.

This study focused on the cytoarchitectonic and morphological differences in
GABA-releasing interneurons between adult Fmr1 knock-out (FMR1KO) and wild-type
(WT) mice in the somatosensory cortex. Our results showed a robust reorganization
of neocortical, but not hippocampal inhibitory circuits in the FMR1KO mouse. The 
reorganization is characterized by a significant reduction (20%, p<0.001) in the 
densities of parvalbumin (PV)-positive, but not calbindin (CB) and calretinin
(CR)-positive interneurons. A significant enlargement of soma size and an altered
lamina distribution of PV but not CR and CB cells was also observed.
Additionally, there was a modest but significant increase in
TrkB-immunoreactivity in PV-positive cells in the FMR1KO mouse. These results
provide the first report showing significant alterations of GABA-releasing
interneurons in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Uncovering the changes in 
specific GABAergic inhibitory circuits could help understand mechanisms
underlying the behavior deficits of fragile X syndrome and autism.

Premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 1
(FMR1) gene are associated with autism spectrum disorder in childhood, premature 
ovarian failure, and the neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FXTAS, and perhaps the other clinical
presentations among carriers, are thought to be due to toxic gain-of-function of 
elevated levels of the expanded-repeat FMR1 mRNA. Previous structural MRI studies
have implicated the amygdala as a potential site of dysfunction underlying social
deficits and/or risk for FXTAS. As a preliminary investigation of this possible
association, adult males with the premutation, and male controls matched for IQ, 
age and education, completed three protocols that probe amygdala and sympathetic 
function: (i) a functional MRI paradigm that measures brain response to fearful
faces; (ii) a fear-potentiated startle paradigm that differentiates responses to 
fearful faces and fearful non-social images and (iii) measurement of skin
conductance level during a brief social encounter. Compared with controls, men
with the FMR1 premutation demonstrated diminished brain activation in the
amygdala and several brain areas that mediate social cognition while viewing
fearful faces. The reduced amygdala activation in the premutation group was
significantly associated with self-report of psychological symptoms on the
Symptom Checklist-90--Revised. These men also displayed a lack of startle
potentiation while viewing fearful faces and showed reduced skin conductance
response when greeting an unfamiliar experimenter in comparison with the control 
group. The current findings may be related to social cognition deficits reported 
previously in children and adults with the premutation. The aetiology for this
dysfunction may be elevated FMR1 mRNA or reduced FMR1 protein that occurs in
carriers with higher premutation CGG repeat alleles.

Recent advances in our understanding of the clinical and molecular features of
the fragile-X mental-retardation 1 gene, FMR1, highlight the importance of
single-gene disorders. 15 years after its discovery, FMR1 continues to reveal new
and unexpected clinical presentations and molecular mechanisms. Loss of function 
of FMR1 is a model for neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders, including
mental retardation, autism, anxiety, and mood instability. In addition,
overexpression and CNS toxicity of FMR1 mRNA causes a late-onset
neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome
(FXTAS). A similar mechanism is probably involved in premature ovarian failure,
which affects up to 20% of female carriers of an altered FMR1 gene.

The distributions of scores for autistic behaviours obtained from the Autism
Diagnostic Observation Scale-Generic (ADOS-G) were investigated in 147 males and 
females affected with the full mutation in the fragile X mental retardation 1
(FMR1) gene, in 59 individuals with the premutation, and in 42 non-fragile X
relatives, aged 4-70 years. The scores representing communication and social
interaction were continuously distributed across the two fragile X groups, and
they were significantly elevated compared with the non-fragile X controls. Strong
relationships were found between both these scores and FMRP deficits, but they
became insignificant for social interaction, and the sum of social interaction
and communication scores, when FSIQ was included as another predictor of autism
scores. Other significant predictors of these scores in both sexes were those
executive skills which related to verbal fluency, and to the regulation and
control of motor behaviour. Overall, our data have shown that cognitive
impairment, especially of verbal skills, best explains the comorbidity of autism 
and fragile X. This implies some more fundamental perturbations of specific
neural connections which are essential for both specific behaviours and
cognition. We also emphasize that FXS offers a unique molecular model for autism 
since FMRP regulates the translation of many other genes involved in synaptic
formation and plasticity which should be natural targets for further exploration.

    Fertil Steril. 2007 Nov;88(5):1477; author reply 1477.

OBJECTIVE: To update clinicians on the reproductive implications of premutations 
in FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1). Fragile X syndrome, a cause of mental
retardation and autism, is due to a full mutation (>200 CGG repeats). Initially, 
individuals who carried the premutation (defined as more than 55 but less than
200 CGG repeats) were not considered at risk for any clinical disorders. It is
now recognized that this was incorrect, specifically with respect to female
reproduction.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Literature review and consensus building at two
multidisciplinary scientific workshops.
CONCLUSION(S): Convincing evidence now relates the FMR1 premutation to altered
ovarian function and loss of fertility. An FMR1 mRNA gain-of-function toxicity
may underlie this altered ovarian function. There are major gaps in knowledge
regarding the natural history of the altered ovarian function in women who carry 
the FMR1 premutation, making counseling about reproductive plans a challenge.
Women with premature ovarian failure are at increased risk of having an FMR1
premutation and should be informed of the availability of fragile X testing.
Specialists in reproductive medicine can provide a supportive environment in
which to explain the implications of FMR1 premutation testing, facilitate access 
to testing, and make appropriate referral to genetic counselors.

Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder appearing before the age of 3, where
communication and social interactions are impaired. It also entails stereotypic
behavior or restricted interests. Although this disorder was first described in
1943, little is still known about its etiology and that of related developmental 
disorders. Work with human patients has provided many data on neuropathological
and cognitive symptoms, but our understanding of the functional defects at the
cellular level and how they come about remains sketchy. To improve this
situation, autism research is in need of valid animal models. However, despite a 
strong hereditary component, attempts to identify genes have generally failed,
suggesting that many different genes are involved. As a high proportion of
patients suffering from the Fragile X Syndrome show many autistic symptoms, a
mouse model of this disorder could potentially also serve as a model for autism. 
The Fmr1 KO mouse is a valid model of the Fragile X Syndrome and many data on
behavioral and sensory-motor characteristics of this model have been gathered. We
present here an assessment of autistic features in this candidate model. We
conclude that Fmr1 KO mice display several autistic-like features, but more work 
is needed to validate this model.

We examined autistic behavior in a cross-sectional sample of 179 children with
fragile X syndrome (FXS) and a longitudinal subset of 116 children using the
Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) to (a) determine a prevalence of autistic
behavior in FXS, (b) examine the stability of autistic ratings over time, and (c)
assess the association between the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
and autistic behavior. Approximately 21% of the sample of 129 children (25.9% of 
boys) scored at or above the cutoff for autism. CARS scores increased slowly, yet
significantly, over time, and low levels of FMRP were associated with higher mean
levels of autistic behavior as measured by the CARS.

Strasbourg cedex, France.

OBJECTIVE: X inactivation pattern in X chromosome rearrangements usually favor
the less unbalanced cells. It is correlated to a normal phenotype, small size or 
infertility. We studied the correlation between phenotype and X inactivation
ratio in patients with X structural anomalies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the 1999-2005 period, 12 X chromosome
rearrangements, including three prenatal cases, were diagnosed in the Laboratoire
de Cytogénétique of Strasbourg. In seven cases, X inactivation ratio could be
assessed by late replication or methylation assay.
RESULTS: In three of seven cases (del Xp, dup Xp, t(X;A)), X inactivation ratio
and phenotype were consistent. The four other cases showed discrepancies between 
phenotype and X inactivation pattern: mental retardation and dysmorphism in a
case of balanced X-autosome translocation, schizophrenia and autism in two cases 
of XX maleness and MLS syndrome (microphthalmia with linear skin defects) in a
case of Xp(21.3-pter) deletion.
CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between X inactivation ratio and phenotype are not rare
and can be due to gene disruption, position effect, complex microrearrangements, 
variable pattern of X inactivation in different tissues or fortuitous
association. In this context, the prognostic value of X inactivation study in
prenatal diagnosis will be discussed.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a full mutation expansion (>200 CGG
repeats) in the FMR1 gene that results in a deficiency of the fragile X mental
retardation protein. Although most individuals with the premutation (55-200 CGG
repeats) are considered unaffected by FXS, recent case studies have documented
children with the premutation who have cognitive deficits, behavioral problems,
and/or autism spectrum disorders. The objective of this study was to compare the 
prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) symptoms in boys with the premutation who presented as probands, 
in brothers with the premutation who did not present as probands, and in normal
brothers of premutation and/or full mutation carriers. Participants included 43
male children: 14 probands who presented to clinic, 13 nonprobands who were
identified through cascade testing (routine genetic testing of family members
after identification of a proband) and confirmed to have the premutation, and a
control group of 16 male siblings of individuals with the fragile X premutation
or full mutation who were negative for the FMR1 mutation. Participants came from 
1 of 2 collaborative sites: University of California, Davis and La Trobe
University in Australia. Parents completed the Conners' Global Index-Parent
Version for assessing symptoms of ADHD and the Social Communication Questionnaire
(SCQ) for identifying symptoms of ASD. Children who were in the ASD range on the 
SCQ (n = 13) underwent further evaluation with either the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Schedule-Generic (n = 10) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised 
(n = 3). A final diagnosis of ASD included clinical assessment utilizing
DSM-IV-TR criteria in addition to the standardized assessments. There was a
higher rate of ASD in boys with the premutation presenting as probands (p <
0.001) or nonprobands (p < .04) compared with sibling controls without the
premutation. In addition, probands had a significant increase in ADHD symptoms
compared with controls (p < .0001). Of the probands, 93% had symptoms of ADHD and
79% had ASD. In the nonproband premutation group, 38% had symptoms of ADHD and 8%
had ASD. Thirteen percent of sibling controls had symptoms of ADHD and none had
ASD. IQ scores were similar in all 3 groups (p = .13), but the use of
psychotropic medications was significantly higher in probands with the
premutation compared with that in controls (p < .0001). Developmental problems
have been observed in premutation carriers, particularly those who present
clinically with behavioral difficulties. Although this study is based on a small 
sample size, it suggests that premutation carriers, even those who do not present
clinically, may be at increased risk for an ASD and/or symptoms of ADHD. If the
premutation is identified through cascade testing, then further assessment should
be carried out for symptoms of ADHD, social deficits, or learning disabilities.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will describe recent developments in the
neurobiology of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the association between FXS and autism,
and involvement in premutation carriers.
RECENT FINDINGS: Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-coupled pathways are 
dysregulated in individuals with FXS and this is thought to relate to the FXS
phenotype. The mGluR5 model suggests that mGluR5 antagonists, including
downstream effectors such as lithium, could be useful for treating FXS. Two forms
of clinical involvement associated with the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1)
gene, autism and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), have
received additional attention during the past year. One study has found that
approximately 30% of individuals with FXS have autism; those with autism have
lowered cognitive abilities, language problems, and behavioral difficulties
compared to those with FXS alone. Furthermore, evidence is mounting that autism
also occurs in some young males who have premutation alleles. Finally, males and 
occasional females with premutation alleles may develop a neurological syndrome
with aging that consists of tremor, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive 
deficits. Significant brain atrophy and white-matter disease is usually seen.
This new disorder (FXTAS) is thought to be related to elevated levels of abnormal
FMR1 mRNA.
SUMMARY: Full-mutation forms of the gene (> 200 repeats) can cause autism,
learning disabilities, anxiety disorders, and mental retardation. Disorders
associated with premutation forms of the gene (55-200 repeats) include, in
addition to autism, FXTAS in older males and females, and premature ovarian
failure.

INTRODUCTION: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of hereditary
mental retardation, as well as being a common cause of learning disorders and
psychiatric problems. It is characterised by very specific physical and
behavioural phenotypes. For this reason FXS is an excellent model of the relation
between behaviour and genes. FXS is also the commonest cause of autism identified
to date. Between 2 and 6% of children with autism have FXS, and approximately 3% 
of children with FXS have autism.
DEVELOPMENT: The paper takes these findings as the basis on which to deal with
the complex relations between FXS and autism. The relations between autism and
gene FMR1, which causes FXS, are not limited to the complete mutation -some
extremely interesting correlations between autism and the premutation of this
gene are also being found.
CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of an increase in mRNA in gene FMR1 in the premutation
has facilitated our understanding of the complex pathology associated to the
premutation. These findings open up a line of research that will not only enable 
us to further our understanding of the genetics of FXS, but can also help us to
comprehend the complex genetic interactions that give rise to autism.

The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) mutation causes two disorders:
fragile X syndrome (FXS) in those with the full mutation and the fragile
X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in some older individuals with the
premutation. FXS is caused by a deficiency of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) leading to 
dysregulation of many genes that create a phenotype with ADHD, anxiety, and
autism. FXTAS is caused by the elevation of FMR1-mRNA to levels 2 to 8 times
normal in the premutation. This causes an RNA gain of function toxicity leading
to brain atrophy, white matter disease, neuronal and astrocytic inclusion
formation, and subsequent ataxia, intention tremor, peripheral neuropathy, and
cognitive decline. The neurobiology and pathophysiology of FXS and FXTAS are
described in detail.

Social behavior deficits in the Fmr1 mutant mouse.

Mineur YS(1), Huynh LX, Crusio WE.

Author information:

Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.

Mice exhibiting deficits in social behavior may provide valuable models for
autistic-like behavioral problems. We tested social interactions in male mice
from three inbred strains: C57BL/6J (B6), BALB/cJ (C) and DBA/2J (D2). All three 
strains showed gradual habituation of the number of social interactions with an
ovariectomized female over four subsequent 2min sessions, returning to initial
levels when presented with another stimulus mouse. Next, we studied males with a 
knockout mutation in the Fmr1 gene on a B6 background. KO animals showed strongly
reduced levels of social interaction, which were about similar as those of
habituated controls. This social behavior deficit suggests that Fmr1 KO mice
could possibly be used as models for autistic behaviors.

In a prospective study in Kuwait, 182 mentally retarded male patients who
fulfilled 5 or more clinical criteria of fragile X syndrome were screened using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Twenty patients (11%) were highly
suspected of having fragile X syndrome due to mutation at the FRAXA locus; none
had mutation at the FRAXE locus. Of these, 11 (55%) were confirmed
fragile-X-positive by both cytogenetic and PCR techniques. The most frequent
clinical features were: prominent forehead, high arched palate, hyperextensible
joints, long ears, prominent jaw, height > 10th centile and attention-deficit
hyperactivity. Less common were avoidance of eye contact (45%), autism (45%) and 
seizures (30%). Large testes were found in 55% of cases. Pre-pubertal and
post-pubertal clinical criteria were different.

Blink rate in boys with fragile X syndrome: preliminary evidence for altered
dopamine function.

Author information:

Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. roberts2@mail.fpg.unc.edu

BACKGROUND: Dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in motor and cognitive
functioning, can be non-invasively measured via observation of spontaneous blink 
rates. Blink rates have been studied in a number of clinical conditions including
schizophrenia, autism, Parkinsons, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
with results implicating either hyper or hypo dopaminergic states.
METHODS: This study examined spontaneous blink rate in boys with fragile X
syndrome (FXS). Blink rates of boys (4-8 years old) with FXS (n = 6) were
compared with those of age-matched typically developing boys (n = 6) during
active and passive tasks. Blink rates (blinks per minute) for each task were
compared between the two groups. Then, the relation between blink measures and
core FXS-related features [problem behaviours, arousal, fmr 1 protein (FMRP)]
were examined within the group of boys with FXS.
RESULTS: Blink rate in boys with FXS was significantly higher than typically
developing boys during passive tasks. Within the FXS group, there were
significant correlations between blink rate and problem behaviours and
physiological arousal (i.e. heart activity) but not with FMRP.
CONCLUSIONS: Observed differences in spontaneous blink rate between boys with and
without FXS and the relation between blink rate and physiological and behavioural
measures in boys with FXS suggests that further work examining dopamine
dysfunction as a factor in the pathophysiology of FXS may be warranted.

fragile X region.

Sciences, Windeyer Institute of Medical Science, University College London,

The higher prevalence of autism in males than in females suggests the possible
involvement of the X chromosome. To test the hypothesis that there are mutations 
increasing susceptibility to autism on the X chromosome, and in particular the
distal portion of the long arm that encompasses the FMRI and MECP2 loci, a
genetic linkage study was performed. Twenty-two fragile X-negative families
multiplex for autism and related disorders were used for the study. Linkage
analysis, for markers in the Xq27-q28 region, using model-free likelihood-based
analysis, produced a maximum MLOD of 1.7 for the narrowest diagnostic category of
the typical autism/severe autism spectrum, and nonparametric analysis produced a 
maximum non-parametric lod (NPL) score of 2.1 for a broad phenotype diagnostic
model. Thus, this study offers modest support for a susceptibility locus for
autism within the Xq27-q28 region. Further genetic investigations of this region 
are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Given the consistent findings of theory of mind deficits in children 
with autism, it would be extremely beneficial to examine the profile of theory of
mind abilities in other clinical groups such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down
syndrome (DS). Aim The aim of the present study was to assess whether boys with
FXS are impaired in simple social situations that require them to understand
their own and others' mental states - in essence: do they have a 'theory of
mind'?
METHOD: Well-standardized tasks of theory of mind, the location change false
belief task and the appearance-reality tasks were employed to examine whether any
impairment might be specific to the FXS or part of a more generalized
developmental deficit.
RESULTS: The results suggest that children with FXS do have impairment in theory 
of mind that is comparable to the deficit reported in other groups with learning 
disabilities such as DS. However, closer inspection of the impairment between
these groups revealed qualitative differences in error types (realist vs.
phenomenist), suggestive of atypical development that goes beyond general
cognitive delay.
CONCLUSION: The findings are discussed in terms of the teasing apart of different
components of social cognition in order to identify syndrome-specific
deficiencies and proficiencies.

Cytogenetic abnormalities and fragile-X syndrome in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Reddy KS(1).

Author information: 
(1)Genzyme Genetics, Orange CA 92868, USA. kavita.reddy@gmail.com

BACKGROUND: Autism is a behavioral disorder with impaired social interaction,
communication, and repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. About 5-10 % of
individuals with autism have 'secondary' autism in which an environmental agent, 
chromosome abnormality, or single gene disorder can be identified. Ninety percent
have idiopathic autism and a major gene has not yet been identified. We have
assessed the incidence of chromosome abnormalities and Fragile X syndrome in a
population of autistic patients referred to our laboratory.
METHODS: Data was analyzed from 433 patients with autistic traits tested using
chromosome analysis and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or
molecular testing for fragile X syndrome by Southern and PCR methods.
RESULTS: The median age was 4 years. Sex ratio was 4.5 males to 1 female
[354:79]. A chromosome (cs) abnormality was found in 14/421 [3.33 %] cases. The
aberrations were: 4/14 [28%] supernumerary markers; 4/14 [28%] deletions; 1/14
[7%] duplication; 3/14 [21%] inversions; 2/14 [14%] translocations. FISH was
performed on 23 cases for reasons other than to characterize a previously
identified cytogenetic abnormality. All 23 cases were negative. Fragile-X testing
by Southern blots and PCR analysis found 7/316 [2.2 %] with an abnormal result.
The mutations detected were: a full mutation (fM) and abnormal methylation in 3
[43 %], mosaic mutations with partial methylation of variable clinical
significance in 3 [43%] and a permutation carrier [14%]. The frequency of
chromosome and fragile-X abnormalities appears to be within the range in reported
surveys (cs 4.8-1.7%, FRAX 2-4%). Limitations of our retrospective study include 
paucity of behavioral diagnostic information, and a specific clinical criterion
for testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-eight percent of chromosome abnormalities detected in our
study were subtle; therefore a high resolution cytogenetic study with a scrutiny 
of 15q11.2q13, 2q37 and Xp23.3 region should be standard practice when the
indication is autism. The higher incidence of mosaic fragile-X mutations with
partial methylation compared to FRAXA positive population [50% vs 15-40%]
suggests that faint bands and variations in the Southern band pattern may occur
in autistic patients.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of mental
retardation. It is also one of the most common identifiable causes of Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Carriers of FXS are often considered to be cognitively
and behaviorally unaffected. However, we report here on six individuals in the
premutation range who also have ASD. A comparison is made with five subjects in
the premutation range who did not receive a diagnosis of ASD. The six individuals
with ASD had a range of cognitive ability levels from no impairment to moderate
retardation. Discussion includes the impact of molecular variables including
lowered FMR1 protein and elevated FMR1 mRNA in addition to environmental factors 
leading to the complex neurodevelopmental disorder of ASD.

Plasticity of nonneuronal brain tissue: roles in developmental disorders.

Dong WK(1), Greenough WT.

Author information:

61801, USA.

Neuronal and nonneuronal plasticity are both affected by environmental and
experiential factors. Remodeling of existing neurons induced by such factors has 
been observed throughout the brain, and includes alterations in dendritic field
dimensions, synaptogenesis, and synaptic morphology. The brain loci affected by
these plastic neuronal changes are dependent on the type of experience and
learning. Increased neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is a
well-documented response to environmental complexity ("enrichment") and learning.
Exposure to challenging experiences and learning opportunities also alters
existing glial cells (i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), and up-regulates
gliogenesis, in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Such glial plasticity often
parallels neuronal remodeling in both time and place, and this enhanced
morphological synergism may be important for optimizing the functional
interaction between glial cells and neurons. Aberrant structural plasticity of
nonneuronal elements is a contributing factor, as is aberrant neuron plasticity, 
to neurological and developmental disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and mental 
retardation (i.e., fragile X syndrome). Some of these nonneuronal pathologies
include abnormal cerebral and cerebellar white matter and myelin-related proteins
in autism; abnormal myelin basic protein in fragile X syndrome (FXS); and
abnormal astrocytes in autism, FXS, and epilepsy. A number of recent studies
demonstrate the possibility of using environmental and experiential intervention 
to reduce or ameliorate some of the neuronal and nonneuronal abnormalities, as
well as behavioral deficits, present in these neurological and developmental
disorders.

The mGluR theory of fragile X mental retardation.

Many of the diverse functional consequences of activating group 1 metabotropic
glutamate receptors require translation of pre-existing mRNA near synapses. One
of these consequences is long-term depression (LTD) of transmission at
hippocampal synapses. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the
defect responsible for fragile X syndrome in humans, increases LTD in mouse
hippocampus. This finding is consistent with the growing evidence that FMRP
normally functions as a repressor of translation of specific mRNAs. Here we
present a theory that can account for diverse neurological and psychiatric
aspects of fragile X syndrome, based on the assumption that many of the
protein-synthesis-dependent functions of metabotropic receptors are exaggerated
in fragile X syndrome. The theory suggests new directions for basic research as
well as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of humans with fragile X, 
the most frequent inherited cause of mental retardation and an identified cause
of autism.

Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the FMR1 gene in autistic and
mentally retarded children in Japan.

Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in
males, and patients with fragile X syndrome occasionally develop autism. It is
usually caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated
region of the FMR1 gene, but in a small number of patients deletions and point
mutations have been identified. We screened all 17 exons of the FMR1 gene for
mutations in 90 autistic or mentally retarded children using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. No
mutations were found in 76 male patients. However, one female patient was
heterozygous for a normal allele and a mutant allele with an A to C substitution 
at nucleotide 879 in exon 9. This mutation was not found in 50 controls. Reverse 
transcription-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the mutant transcripts were
spliced aberrantly, causing premature termination of the protein synthesis.
Although uncommon, point mutations in the FMR1 gene may be a cause of autism and 
mental retardation in Japanese patients.

Sensorimotor gating abnormalities in young males with fragile X syndrome and

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single gene (FMR1) disorder affecting
cognitive and behavioral function in humans. This syndrome is characterized by a 
cluster of abnormalities including lower IQ, attention deficits, impairments in
adaptive behavior and increased incidence of autism. Here, we show that young
males with FXS have profound deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI), a basic
marker of sensorimotor gating that has been extensively studied in rodents.
Importantly, the magnitude of the PPI impairments in the fragile X children
predicted the severity of their IQ, attention, adaptive behavior and autistic
phenotypes. Additionally, these measures were highly correlated with each other, 
suggesting that a shared mechanism underlies this complex phenotypic cluster.
Studies in Fmr1-knockout mice also revealed sensorimotor gating and learning
abnormalities. However, PPI and learning were enhanced rather than reduced in the
mutants. Therefore, these data show that mutations of the FMR1 gene impact
equivalent processes in both humans and mice. However, since these phenotypic
changes are opposite in direction, they also suggest that murine compensatory
mechanisms following loss of FMR1 function differ from those in humans.

Evidence from the high male to female ratio of individuals with autism as well as
suggestive linkage data have implicated the possible involvement of X chromosomal
loci in the aetiology of autism. Studies of the FMR1 gene on Xq27 have shown that
occasionally individuals, and particularly females, with the [CGG] repeat
expansion and methylation mutation may present with autistic symptoms. However,
molecular studies suggest that such mutations are not a major cause of autism.
Previously, we have screened autism probands for mutations in regions of the FMR1
gene downstream of the [CGG] repeat and identified an intronic variant in the
FMR1 gene, IVS10 + 14C-T, which was present at a significantly higher frequency
in autistic individuals compared to controls individuals. We have now
investigated this variant in a further 136 autism families and 186 control
individuals. We have established that the variant is significantly more frequent 
among East Asian individuals within our affected and control groups (P < 0.0001) 
and although we observed a trend of higher transmission frequency of the rare
allele to affected individuals, there was no significant evidence in either
family-based or case/control association studies for this variant in autism (P > 
0.05).

Fragile X syndrome has a characteristic behavioural and physical phenotype.
Clinical experience and case reports suggest that boys with premutations and
intermediate alleles may have similar, but possibly milder, clinical features
than those with the full mutation. We conducted detailed physical, psychiatric,
psychological and speech and language evaluations on a clinical series of 10
boys, with either premutation or intermediate CGG triplet expansions. Wherever
possible we measured the levels of FMR1 protein in participants' hair roots. Many
participants demonstrated striking resemblance in their clinical picture,
behavioural and physical, to individuals with the fragile X syndrome full
mutation. However, protein expression was normal in all participants where it was
assessed, despite large variation in CGG triplet repeats. We propose that the
findings are unlikely to be attributable to ascertainment bias alone. Replication
on larger independent samples is required to confirm our impression that fragile 
X premutations and intermediate alleles may be associated with important
developmental disabilities and physical features.

In this study, we distributed surveys to 67 families of young boys with fragile X
syndrome to determine the prevalence, onset, form, function, location, and
correlates of self-injurious behavior. Fifty-five surveys were completed (82%).
The mean age of the boys at the time of the survey was 80 months (range =
20-144). Self-injurious behavior (SIB) was reported for 58% of the participants
with a mean age of onset of 31 months. The mean number of forms of self-injury
was 2 per participant. Biting was the most commonly reported form of self-injury 
with the fingers and back of the hand disproportionately targeted as the most
prevalent self-injury body site. There was no linear increase in risk of SIB with
age past 25 months. SIB was reported as most likely to occur following the
presentation of difficult task demands or changes in routine. Significant group
differences were found between overall ratings of problem behavior for boys with 
self-injury compared to those without self-injury. Groups did not differ on
measures of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), autism status, adaptive 
behavior, or age first medicated. Results are discussed in terms of future
research designed to further elucidate the behavioral phenotype of fragile X
syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Fragile X syndrome, which is produced by mutation of a gene in the 
X chromosome, is the most frequent cause of hereditary mental retardation. The
multisystemic alterations of the disorder are due to the inhibition of the
expression of the FMR1 gene and to the lack or absence of FMRP protein. Mental
retardation and autistic spectrum constitute the most serious manifestations of
the syndrome, but there are numerous neuropsychological disorders that make up
the cognitive behavioural (CB) phenotype of patients, and the number of clinical 
manifestations they are going to present is also high.
AIMS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the parameters that can contribute to 
the elaboration of a set of generally agreed guidelines that include early
diagnosis and the indispensable genetic counselling, as well as a
multidisciplinary intervention that contemplates, in a global manner, the medical
and educational needs of those affected.
METHODOLOGY: The method used to conduct the study involved an analysis of the
early manifestations of the disease and the neuropsychological aspects of those
affected, by means of a study protocol that includes biological and pedagogical
data together with batteries of standard tests.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results confront us with the delay in
diagnosis and in genetic counselling because the CB phenotype, in which language 
disorders were the most constant element, is not taken as being an early sign of 
the clinical manifestations or as a serious interference factor in the cognitive 
aspects in the progress of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Many observations indicate that genetic factors play an important
role in the aetiology of autism. Up to now, however, no genetic markers have been
convincingly identified which influence the predisposition to this disorder.
Complex genetic analysis of autistic patients and their families may therefore
lead to the identification of features which could help to direct further search 
for the predisposing genes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We have analysed a sample of 20 patients with autism
spectrum disorders. The patients have been subjected to clinical genetic
examination, cytogenetic analysis and DNA analysis of the FMR1 gene. In the
sample studied we have observed more boys (15/20), various degree of mental
retardation (18/20), high frequency of complications during pregnancy (10/20) and
delivery (10/20), increased incidence of psychiatric disorders, behavioural
abnormalities and suicides among the relatives, and increased head circumference 
and unusually formed ears in the probands. Three patients had different
chromosomal aberrations or variants (t(21;22), inv(9) and inv(10)). One patient
harboured expansion of the trinucleotide repeat sequence in the FMR1 gene on the 
full mutation level which is characteristic for the fragile X syndrome, and one
patient is suspected to suffer from the Rett syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations confirm and extend the results reported in the
literature. Most interesting are mainly the macrocephaly which may be associated 
with the recently described increased neonatal levels of neural growth factors in
autistic individuals, ear malformations which may indicate aberrations in the
HOXA1 gene pathway, the occurrence of chromosomal inversions recurrent in autism,
and peculiarities in the pedigrees of the patients.

OBJECTIVE: Fragile X syndrome, caused by mutations in a single gene of the X
chromosome (FMR1), is associated with neurobehavioral characteristics including
social deficits with peers, social withdrawal, gaze aversion, inattention,
hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, and autistic behavior. However, there is
considerable variability in the behavioral and psychiatric problems among
children with this condition. The purpose of this study was to measure genetic
and environmental factors influencing behavior problems and autistic symptoms in 
children with fragile X syndrome.
DESIGN: We conducted an in-home evaluation of 120 children (80 boys and 40 girls)
with the fragile X full mutation and their unaffected siblings, including
measurements of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), quality of the home environment,
maternal and paternal psychopathology, effectiveness of educational and
therapeutic services, and child behavior problems.
RESULTS: Results of multiple regression analyses showed that for boys with
fragile X, effectiveness of educational and therapeutic services and parental
psychological problems predicted internalizing and externalizing types of
problems, while the quality of the home environment predicted autistic behavior. 
For girls with fragile X, the results emphasized significant effects of FMRP on
behavior, in particular social withdrawal and anxious/depressed behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are among the first to link FMRP expression to
behavior. They also emphasize the significance of home- and school-based
environmental variables in the neurobehavioral phenotype and help to lay the
foundation for studies designed to identify specific interventions for reducing
problem behavior in children with fragile X syndrome.

In the context of a longitudinal study, we assessed the relationship between
ratings of autistic behavior, FMR1 protein expression (FMRP), and the
developmental trajectories of 55 young males with fragile X syndrome. Autistic
behavior, as measured by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, was not related to
FMRP expression. However, autistic behavior was a significant predictor of both
developmental status and developmental change. Boys with both autistic behavior
and fragile X syndrome functioned at significantly lower levels of development
and grew at significantly slower rates than those without autistic behavior. FMRP
expression accounted for less variance in developmental level than did autistic
behavior, and was not significantly related to slope (developmental change over
time). No autistic behavior x FMRP interaction was found.

Fragile X mice develop sensory hyperreactivity to auditory stimuli.

York Avenue, LC 522, New York, NY 10021, USA.

Fragile X syndrome is the most prevalent cause of mental retardation. It is
usually caused by the transcriptional inactivation of the FMR-1 gene. Although
the cognitive defect is the most recognized symptom of fragile X syndrome,
patients also show behavioral problems such as hyperarousal, hyperactivity,
autism, aggression, anxiety and increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Here we
investigated whether fragile X mice (fmr-1 gene knockout mice) exhibit abnormal
sensitivity to sensory stimuli. First, hyperreactivity of fragile X mice to
auditory stimulus was indicated in the prepulse inhibition paradigm. A moderately
intense prepulse tone, that suppresses startle response to a strong auditory
stimulus, elicited a significantly stronger effect in fragile X than in control
mice. Second, sensory hyperreactivity of fragile X mice was demonstrated by a
high seizure susceptibility to auditory stimulation. Selective induction of
c-Fos, an early-immediate gene product, indicated that seizures involve auditory 
brainstem and thalamic nuclei. Audiogenic seizures were not due to a general
increase in brain excitability because three different chemical convulsants
(kainic acid, bicuculline and pentylenetetrazole) elicited similar effects in
fragile X and wild-type mice. These data are consistent with the increased
responsiveness of fragile X patients to auditory stimuli. The auditory
hypersensitivity suggests an abnormal processing in the auditory system of
fragile X mice, which could provide a useful model to study the molecular and
cellular changes underlying fragile X syndrome.

FMR1 gene and fragile X syndrome.

Bardoni B(1), Mandel JL, Fisch GS.

Taxonomic features of fragile X syndrome (FXS) associated with the fragile X
mutation have evolved over several decades. Males are more severely impacted
cognitively than females, but both show declines in IQ scores as they age.
Although many males with FXS exhibit autistic-like features, autism does not
occur more frequently in males with FXS than among males with mental retardation 
(MR). FXS is caused by inactivation of the FMR1 gene located on Xq27.3. FMRP, the
protein produced by FMR1, has been detected in most organs and in brain. In
cells, it is located primarily in cytoplasm and contains motifs found in
RNA-binding proteins. The FMRP N-terminal contains a functional nuclear
localization signal which permits the protein to shuttle between cytoplasm and
nucleus. FMR1 knockout mice show subtle behavioral and visual-spatial
difficulties. Analysis of their brain tissue suggests absence of FMRP impairs
synaptic maturation. Individuals with the fragile premutation produce FMRP, and
the phenotype associated with the premutation has been controversial. However,
there seems to be a higher incidence of premature ovarian failure in women with
the premutation than is found in the general female population. This may be
related to unusual increases in mRNA levels in premutation carriers.

Fragile X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from a single
gene mutation on the X chromosome. The purpose of this review is to summarize key
advances made in understanding the fragile X premutation gene seen in carriers
and the full mutation gene seen in persons with the syndrome. DNA testing has
replaced cytogenetic testing as the primary method for identification of fragile 
X, although the efficacy of protein level screening is being explored. The
premutation is associated with no effects, although there is evidence of physical
effects-primarily premature menopause and mild outward features of the fragile X 
syndrome-among premutation carriers. There is much controversy regarding
premutation effects on psychological development. The few experimental studies
carried out to date do not suggest noticeable or significant effects. One
challenge in addressing this controversy is the sometimes ambiguous
differentiation between premutation and full mutation genes. There is a
well-established yet highly variable phenotype of the full mutation. Research
from this decade has helped to address specific aspects of this phenotype,
including the early course of its development in males, the influence of home and
family environments, the nature of social difficulties and autistic features seen
in boys and girls with fragile X, and the potential role of hyperarousal or
hyper-reactivity. Studies in these areas, and on the role of FMR protein, will
contribute towards ongoing advances in our understanding of fragile X syndrome
and its mechanisms. The variability in physical, social, and cognitive features, 
as described in this review, is one that prohibits clear-cut screening guidelines
designed to avoid high rates of both false positives and false negatives. Results
from recent studies indicate the need to consider behavioral features in
selecting candidates for fragile X screening. MRDD Research Reviews

CGG repeat interruptions in the FMR1 gene in patients with infantile autism.

(1)Department of Chemical Pathology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, NT.

We determined the CGG repeat length and AGG interruptions in the FMR1 gene in
normal Chinese subjects and patients with infantile autism and mild mental
retardation. Genomic DNA was investigated by PCR and Southern hybridisation for
CGG repeat number and PCR with Mnl I restriction analysis for AGG interruption.
Both the normal subjects and the patients with autism have 53 CGG repeats in
FMR1, and the majority have two interspersed AGG. Our normal Chinese subjects
have a similar number of interspersed AGG as other populations. When compared
with the normal subjects, the autism patients have less AGG interruptions and a
different pattern of AGG distribution. There was a significant difference in the 
CGG configurations between normal subjects and patients with autism. The latter
had less interspersed AGG, as in fragile X patients, but they did not have
fragile X. A study on mentally retarded patients with no infantile autism should 
also be carried out to ascertain whether mental retardation alone may have
contributed to such AGG pattern.

mutation of FMR-1.

The present French-German cooperative study focuses on the genotype-phenotype
relationship of mutations of the FMR-1 gene and psychiatric conditions in mothers
with a full mutation in the FMR-1 gene of fra-X children (n=13), mothers with a
premutation in the FMR-1 gene of fra-X children (n=61), as well as premutated
siblings of these mothers without affected children (n=17) and two non-mutated
control groups: (1) siblings of these mothers with normal CGG repeat (n=18); and 
(2) mothers of non-fra-X autistic children (n=42). Mothers with a full mutation
in the FMR-1 gene and mothers with a premutation in the FMR-1 gene did not differ
in the frequency of any axis I disorder; however, both groups were diagnosed with
social phobia more often than the control group of mothers of autistic children. 
Moreover, mothers with a premutation in the FMR-1 gene of fra-X children and
their siblings with the premutation (without affected offspring) revealed a
similar frequency of social phobia. Furthermore avoidant personality disorder was
more common in groups of carriers of the full premutation than in siblings
without mutation or than the control group of mothers with autistic children. On 
the basis of our data, we therefore suggest that social avoidance (expressed as
social phobia or avoidant personality disorder) has been underestimated in
previous studies of carriers with the FMR-1 full mutation or premutation.
Comorbidity of axis I and axis II psychiatric diagnoses was mainly restricted to 
the group of carriers of the full mutation and carriers of the premutation of
FMR-1. Correlations between size of CGG repeat and IQ as well as CGG and age of
onset of axis I diagnosis were non-significant. IQ of subjects had no impact on
presence or absence of axis I and/or axis II diagnoses.

Absence of the fragile X CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in girls diagnosed
with a pervasive developmental disorder.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of the fragile X (FRAX)
CGG trinucleotide expansion in a population of young girls (n = 45) diagnosed
with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Their mean age was 43.7 months
(range, 25 to 132 months). Diagnoses included autistic disorder (n = 20), PDD (n 
= 23), and Asperger's syndrome (n = 2). Molecular FRAX testing was performed on
all patients by using the Southern gene blot technique. Genomic DNA was digested 
with both EcoRI and EagI, fractionated on agarose gel, and blotted and probed
with the radiolabeled StB12.3 FMR-1 probe. None of the subjects were found to
have an expansion of CGG in either the 2.8 kb or 5.2 kb fragments. A 95% CI, for 
the prevalence of the FRAX mutation in female subjects with PDD, has an upper
bound of 2.9%. We conclude that the prevalence of FRAX positivity in girls with
PDD is lower than previously reported. This raises the question of whether any
association between FRAX and PDD in female subjects is specific to PDD or is
related rather to the presence of mental retardation.

Molecular and cytogenetic investigations of the fragile X region including the
Frax A and Frax E CGG trinucleotide repeat sequences in families multiplex for
autism and related phenotypes.

We undertook molecular and cytogenetic analyses in 25 families multiplex for
autism and related disorders. Three of the multiplex families exhibited fragile
X, and the affected offspring all exhibited CGG triplet repeat insertion
mutations in the FMR-1 gene. One of these families contained an affected pair of 
monozygotic female twins. Both had similar-sized CGG triplet repeat expansions,
but different phenotypic manifestations. One suffered from autism and the other
from mild mental retardation and marked social anxiety. PCR and Southern
hybridization analysis of the CGG repeat sequences characterizing fragile X A
(Frax A) and E and the methylation status of FMR-1 showed no evidence of abnormal
CGG repeat expansion or FMR-1 hypermethylation in the remaining 22 multiplex
families. Moreover, there was no correlation between the Frax A or E (CGG)n
repeat length with affected status, nor any association with the low-level (< 3
%) expression of cytogenetic fragility at Xq27 previously reported in these
families. Our findings indicate that most instances of recurrence in families
multiplex for autism and related disorders are not accounted for by Frax A and E.
They also indicate that the phenotypic manifestations of Frax A may be influenced
by stochastic, environmental and other biological factors.

A genetic etiology in autism is now strongly supported by family and twin
studies. A 3:1 ratio of affected males to females suggests the involvement of at 
least one X-linked locus in the disease. Several reports have indicated an
association of the fragile X chromosomal anomaly at Xq27.3 (FRAXA) with autism,
whereas others have not supported this finding. We have so far collected blood
from 105 simplex and 18 multiplex families and have assessed 141 patients by
using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Autism Diagnostic
Observation Scale, and psychometric tests. All four ADI-R algorithm criteria were
met by 131 patients (93%), whereas 10 patients (7%) showed a broader phenotype of
autism. Southern blot analysis was performed with three different enzymes, and
filters were hybridized to an FMR-1-specific probe to detect amplification of the
CCG repeat at FRAXA, to the complete FMR-1 cDNA probe, and to additional probes
from the neighborhood of the gene. No significant changes were found in 139
patients (99%) from 122 families, other than the normal variations in the
population. In the case of one multiplex family with three children showing no
dysmorphic features of the fragile X syndrome (one male meeting 3 out of 4
ADI-algorithm criteria, one normal male with slight learning disability but
negative ADI-R testing, and one fully autistic female), the FRAXA
full-mutation-specific CCG-repeat expansion in the genotype was not correlated
with the autism phenotype. Further analysis revealed a mosaic pattern of
methylation at the FMR-1 gene locus in the two sons of the family, indicating at 
least a partly functional gene. Therefore, we conclude that the association of
autism with fragile X at Xq27.3 is non-existent and exclude this location as a
candidate gene region for autism.

Standardized cognitive, behavioral, and neuroanatomical data are presented on 2
unrelated boys with the FRAXE (FMR2) GCC expansion mutation. In the context of
normal IQ, both boys had a history of developmental delay, including significant 
problems with communication, attention, and overactivity. Additionally, one child
was diagnosed with autistic disorder. Data from these 2 cases are compared to
analogous information from previous reports about individuals with the FRAXE or
FRAXA (FMR1) mutation. These comparisons support the idea that FRAXE is
associated with nonspecific developmental delay and possibly high-functioning
autism.

Sib, twin, and family studies have shown that a genetic cause exists in many
cases of autism, with a portion of cases associated with a fragile X chromosome. 
Three folate-sensitive fragile sites in the Xq27-->Xq28 region have been cloned
and found to have polymorphic trinucleotide repeats at the respective sites;
these repeats are amplified and methylated in individuals who are positive for
the different fragile sites. We have tested affected boys and their mothers from 
19 families with two autistic/PDD boys for amplification and/or instability of
the triplet repeats at these loci and concordance of inheritance of alleles by
affected brothers. In all cases, the triplet repeat numbers were within the
normal range, with no individuals having expanded or premutation-size alleles.
For each locus, there was no evidence for an increased frequency of concordance, 
indicating that mutations within these genes are unlikely to be responsible for
the autistic/PDD phenotypes in the affected boys. Thus, we think it is important 
to retest those autistic individuals who were cytogenetically positive for a
fragile X chromosome, particularly cases where there is no family history of the 
fragile X syndrome, using the more accurate DNA-based testing procedures.

Mosaicism for the FMR1 gene influences adaptive skills development in fragile
X-affected males.

Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common forms of inherited mental
retardation, and the first of a new class of genetic disorders associated with
expanded trinucleotide repeats. Previously, we found that about 41% of affected
males are mosaic for this mutation in that some of their blood cells have an
active fragile X gene and others do not. It has been hypothesized that these
mosaic cases should show higher levels of functioning than those who have only
the inactive full mutation gene, but previous studies have provided negative or
equivocal results. In the present study, the cross-sectional development of
communication, self-care, socialization, and motor skills was studied in 46 males
with fragile X syndrome under age 20 years as a function of two variables: age
and the presence or absence of mosaicism. The rate of adaptive skills development
was 2-4 times as great in mosaic cases as in full mutation cases. There was also 
a trend for cases with autism to be more prevalent in the full-mutation group.
These results have implications for prognosis, for the utility of gene or protein
replacement therapies for this disorder, and for understanding the association
between mental retardation, developmental disorders, and fragile X syndrome.

We have analysed all 17 exons of the human FMR-1 gene for mutations in autistic
individuals using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We
have identified three new polymorphisms. SSCP DNA fragment shifts were found for 
exons, 5, 10 and 11 in autistic individuals and in normal controls. Sequence
analysis showed the exon 10 and 11 polymorphisms to result from base
substitutions within introns, 14 and 73 bp downstream from the splice site
respectively. In exon 5, a G to A base substitution at codon 138 has no effect on
amino acid sequence. The intronic polymorphism adjacent to exon 10 was analysed
amongst two groups of unrelated autistic individuals-one from the UK and one from
Germany- and amongst a control population. Comparison of allele frequencies
between Caucasian autism cases and Caucasian controls show a significant increase
in the presence of the polymorphic intronic sequence 3' to exon 10 (Fisher's
exact test, P = 0.01). The base change is at a position where it is unlikely to
affect splicing of the FMR-1 transcript and is most likely a neutral variant that
has only a spurious false positive association with autism. However further
linkage disequilibrium analyses are justifiable. The positive association with
autism should be explored in further samples to determine whether it has any
validity as a genetic marker for autism.

The fragile X form of mental retardation is presently recognized as the most
frequent hereditable cause of mental impairment. The estimated frequency among
males is 1 in 1250, and 1 in 2000 among females. Beside mental impairment and
behavioural disturbance with hyperactivity and autistic features, the patients
are characterized by morphological anomalies, such as an oblong face, broad,
rectangular chin, large protruding ears and macro-orchidism. A less severe
clinical expression can be found among females heterozygotes of the disorder,
manifesting mainly as learning disability. The disorder is associated with the
expression of a fragile site at Xq27.3 under conditions of folate depletion in
the chromosome culture medium. The molecular mechanism is based on the expansion 
of a trinucleotide repeat [CCG]n in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene
resulting in methylation of the gene. The trinucleotide repeat shows variable
lengths of 6 to 53 repeats in the general population, 60 to 200 repeats in
carriers of a premutation and over 200 repeats in patients with fragile X
syndrome.

Approximately 2%-5% of autistic children show cytogenetic evidence of the fragile
X syndrome. This report tests whether infantile autism in multiplex autism
families arises from an unusual manifestion of the fragile X syndrome. This could
arise either by expansion of the (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat in FMR-1 or from a
mutation elsewhere in the gene. We studied 35 families that met stringent
criteria for multiplex autism. Amplification of the trinucleotide repeat and
analysis of methylation status were performed in 79 autistic children and in 31
of their unaffected siblings, by Southern blot analysis. No examples of amplified
repeats were seen in the autistic or control children or in their parents or
grandparents. We next examined the hypothesis that there was a mutation elsewhere
in the FMR-1 gene, by linkage analysis in 32 of these families. We tested four
different dominant models and a recessive model. Linkage to FMR-1 could be
excluded (lod score between -24 and -62) in all models by using probes DXS548,
FRAXAC1, and FRAXAC2 and the CGG repeat itself. Tests for heterogeneity in this
sample were negative, and the occurrence of positive lod scores in this data set 
could be attributed to chance. Analysis of the data by the affected-sib method
also did not show evidence for linkage of any marker to autism. These results
enable us to reject the hypothesis that multiplex autism arises from expansion of
the (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat in FMR-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
