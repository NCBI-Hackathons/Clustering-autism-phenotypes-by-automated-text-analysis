28617938	Fragile X syndrome: An overview and update of the FMR1 gene.         FMR1 expansion, FXPOI, FXTAS, fragile X syndrome, genetic counseling Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and the leading form of the monogenic cause of autism. Fragile X mental retardation type 1 (FMR1) gene premutation is the first single-gene cause of primary ovarian failure (Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency [FXPOI]) and one of the most common causes of ataxia (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]), multiple additional phenotypes such as fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, migraine headaches, sleep disturbances, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, central pain syndrome, neuropathy and neuropsychiatric alterations has been described. Clinical involvement in men and women carrying the FMR1 premutation currently constitutes a real health problem in the society that should be taken into account. It is important to highlight that while in FXS there is a loss-of-function of the FMR1 gene, in premutation associated disorders there is a gain of FMR1 mRNA function. To date, the tremendous progress achieved in the understanding of the pathophysiology of FXS, has led to the development of several targeted therapies aimed at preventing or improving the neurological manifestations of the disease. This review is an update of the diseases associated with the FMR1 gene.          
28632163	Melatonin as a Novel Interventional Candidate for Fragile X Syndrome with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Humans.         autism spectrum disorders, fragile X syndrome (FXS), melatonin, sleep disorder Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS with ASD results from the loss of fragile X mental retardation (        fmr) gene products, including fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which triggers a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities. This disorder is also correlated with clock components underlying behavioral circadian rhythms and, thus, a mutation of the fmr gene can result in disturbed sleep patterns and altered circadian rhythms. As a result, FXS with ASD individuals may experience dysregulation of melatonin synthesis and alterations in melatonin-dependent signaling pathways that can impair vigilance, learning, and memory abilities, and may be linked to autistic behaviors such as abnormal anxiety responses. Although a wide variety of possible causes, symptoms, and clinical features of ASD have been studied, the correlation between altered circadian rhythms and FXS with ASD has yet to be extensively investigated. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of melatonin on the nervous, immune, and metabolic systems and, even though the utilization of melatonin for sleep dysfunctions in ASD has been considered in clinical research, future studies should investigate its neuroprotective role during the developmental period in individuals with ASD. Thus, the present review focuses on the regulatory circuits involved in the dysregulation of melatonin and disruptions in the circadian system in individuals with FXS with ASD. Additionally, the neuroprotective effects of melatonin intervention therapies, including improvements in neuroplasticity and physical capabilities, are discussed and the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder are reviewed. The authors suggest that melatonin may be a useful treatment for FXS with ASD in terms of alleviating the adverse effects of variations in the circadian rhythm.
11301211	Fragile X mice develop sensory hyperreactivity to auditory stimuli.          Fragile X syndrome is the most prevalent cause of mental retardation. It is usually caused by the transcriptional inactivation of the FMR-1 gene. Although the cognitive defect is the most recognized symptom of fragile X syndrome, patients also show behavioral problems such as hyperarousal, hyperactivity, autism, aggression, anxiety and increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Here we investigated whether fragile X mice (fmr-1 gene knockout mice) exhibit abnormal sensitivity to sensory stimuli. First, hyperreactivity of fragile X mice to auditory stimulus was indicated in the prepulse inhibition paradigm. A moderately intense prepulse tone, that suppresses startle response to a strong auditory stimulus, elicited a significantly stronger effect in fragile X than in control mice. Second, sensory hyperreactivity of fragile X mice was demonstrated by a high seizure susceptibility to auditory stimulation. Selective induction of c-Fos, an early-immediate gene product, indicated that seizures involve auditory brainstem and thalamic nuclei. Audiogenic seizures were not due to a general increase in brain excitability because three different chemical convulsants (kainic acid, bicuculline and pentylenetetrazole) elicited similar effects in fragile X and wild-type mice. These data are consistent with the increased responsiveness of fragile X patients to auditory stimuli. The auditory hypersensitivity suggests an abnormal processing in the auditory system of fragile X mice, which could provide a useful model to study the molecular and cellular changes underlying fragile X syndrome.        
25562659	Fragile X mice have robust mGluR5-dependent alterations of social behaviour in the Automated Tube Test.         ERK, Fragile X, Glutamate receptor, Social behaviour, Tube Fragile X syndrome is the most common monogenetic form of intellectual disability and autism. Although the Fmr1 knockout mouse model recapitulates many aspects of the human FXS condition, the establishment of robust social behavioural phenotypes suitable for drug screening has been difficult. Here, we describe a novel social behavioural paradigm, the Automated Tube Test (ATT), for which Fmr1 knockout mice demonstrate a highly reliable and robust phenotype. Fmr1 KO mice show highly dominant behaviour over wild-type littermates in the ATT. Consistent with previous findings, we observed a highly significant, albeit partial, rescue of the altered social behaviour of Fmr1 knockout mice in the ATT, using genetic (mGluR5 deletion) or pharmacological inhibition (mGluR5 antagonist) of mGluR5 signalling independently. Together, our results validate the Automated Tube Test as a robust outcome measure for social behaviour in preclinical research for FXS, and confirm the pathophysiological relevance of mGluR5 signalling. Moreover, our findings highlight the strategy of initiating pharmacological intervention in adulthood as holding significant clinical potential.           
26361565	Psychosis and catatonia in fragile X: Case report and literature review.         Catatonia, fragile X syndrome, premutation, psychosis Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation associated phenotypes have been explored extensively since the molecular mechanism emerged involving elevated FMR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels. Lowered fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) can also occur which may have an additive effect to the high levels of mRNA leading to neurodevelopmental problems and psychopathology. This paper was aimed to review psychosis and catatonia in premutation carriers, express the role of elevated FMR1 mRNA and lowered FMRP in the phenotype of carriers and present a case of psychosis and catatonia in a carrier. This case also demonstrates additional genetic and environmental factors which may also affect the phenotype. We review the literature and report an exemplary case of a 25 year old male premutation carrier with elevated FMR1 mRNA, low FMRP, a cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily D polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6)*2xN mutation and a perinatal insult. This patient developed an autism spectrum disorder, psychosis, catatonia with subsequent cognitive decline after electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) for his catatonia. He had a premutation of 72 CGG repeat in FMR1, FMR1 mRNA level that was over 2.4 times normal and FMRP level at 18% of normal, and additionally, a CYP2D6 allelic variant which leads to ultrarapid metabolism (UM) of medication. There is an overlapping pathophysiological mechanism of catatonia and fragile X-associated premutation phenotypes including autism and psychosis. This case demonstrates the shared phenotype and the overlap of the pathophysiological mechanisms that can influence the intervention. Multiple genetic and environmental hits can lead to more significant involvement in premutation carriers.         
26365141	Advances in the Understanding of the Gabaergic Neurobiology of FMR1 Expanded Alleles Leading to Targeted Treatments for Fragile X Spectrum Disorder.          Fragile X spectrum disorder (FXSD) includes: fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), as well as other medical, psychiatric and neurobehavioral problems associated with the premutation and gray zone alleles. FXS is the most common monogenetic cause of autism (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). The understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has led to many targeted treatment trials in FXS. The first wave of phase II clinical trials in FXS were designed to target the mGluR5 pathway; however the results did not show significant efficacy and the trials were terminated. The advances in the understanding of the GABA system in FXS have shifted the focus of treatment trials to GABA agonists, and a new wave of promising clinical trials is under way. Ganaxolone and allopregnanolone (GABA agonists) have been studied in individuals with FXSD and are currently in phase II trials. Both allopregnanolone and ganaxolone may be efficacious in treatment of FXS and FXTAS, respectively. Allopregnanolone, ganaxolone, riluzole, gaboxadol, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are potential GABAergic treatments. The lessons learned from the initial trials have not only shifted the targeted system, but also have refined the design of clinical trials. The results of these new trials will likely impact further clinical trials for FXS and other genetic disorders associated with ASD.         
26374839	Crystal structure reveals specific recognition of a G-quadruplex RNA by a β-turn in the RGG motif of FMRP.         FMRP, G-quadruplex, RGG box, RNA structure, fragile X syndrome Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is a regulatory RNA binding protein that plays a central role in the development of several human disorders including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism. FMRP uses an arginine-glycine-rich (RGG) motif for specific interactions with guanine (G)-quadruplexes, mRNA elements implicated in the disease-associated regulation of specific mRNAs. Here we report the 2.8-Å crystal structure of the complex between the human FMRP RGG peptide bound to the in vitro selected G-rich RNA. In this model system, the RNA adopts an intramolecular K(+)-stabilized G-quadruplex structure composed of three G-quartets and a mixed tetrad connected to an RNA duplex. The RGG peptide specifically binds to the duplex-quadruplex junction, the mixed tetrad, and the duplex region of the RNA through shape complementarity, cation-π interactions, and multiple hydrogen bonds. Many of these interactions critically depend on a type I β-turn, a secondary structure element whose formation was not previously recognized in the RGG motif of FMRP. RNA mutagenesis and footprinting experiments indicate that interactions of the peptide with the duplex-quadruplex junction and the duplex of RNA are equally important for affinity and specificity of the RGG-RNA complex formation. These results suggest that specific binding of cellular RNAs by FMRP may involve hydrogen bonding with RNA duplexes and that RNA duplex recognition can be a characteristic RNA binding feature for RGG motifs in other proteins.         
24046358	Fragile X mental retardation protein regulates trans-synaptic signaling in Drosophila.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited determinant of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, is caused by loss of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene product (FMRP), an mRNA-binding translational repressor. A number of conserved FMRP targets have been identified in the well-characterized Drosophila FXS disease model, but FMRP is highly pleiotropic in function and the full spectrum of FMRP targets has yet to be revealed. In this study, screens for upregulated neural proteins in Drosophila fmr1 (dfmr1) null mutants reveal strong elevation of two synaptic heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs): GPI-anchored glypican Dally-like protein (Dlp) and transmembrane Syndecan (Sdc). Our recent work has shown that Dlp and Sdc act as co-receptors regulating extracellular ligands upstream of intracellular signal transduction in multiple trans-synaptic pathways that drive synaptogenesis. Consistently, dfmr1 null synapses exhibit altered WNT signaling, with changes in both Wingless (Wg) ligand abundance and downstream Frizzled-2 (Fz2) receptor C-terminal nuclear import. Similarly, a parallel anterograde signaling ligand, Jelly belly (Jeb), and downstream ERK phosphorylation (dpERK) are depressed at dfmr1 null synapses. In contrast, the retrograde BMP ligand Glass bottom boat (Gbb) and downstream signaling via phosphorylation of the transcription factor MAD (pMAD) seem not to be affected. To determine whether HSPG upregulation is causative for synaptogenic defects, HSPGs were genetically reduced to control levels in the dfmr1 null background. HSPG correction restored both (1) Wg and Jeb trans-synaptic signaling, and (2) synaptic architecture and transmission strength back to wild-type levels. Taken together, these data suggest that FMRP negatively regulates HSPG co-receptors controlling trans-synaptic signaling during synaptogenesis, and that loss of this regulation causes synaptic structure and function defects characterizing the FXS disease state.         
24050404	CYFIP1 coordinates mRNA translation and cytoskeleton remodeling to ensure proper dendritic spine formation.          The CYFIP1/SRA1 gene is located in a chromosomal region linked to various neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. CYFIP1 plays a dual role in two apparently unrelated processes, inhibiting local protein synthesis and favoring actin remodeling. Here, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-driven synaptic signaling releases CYFIP1 from the translational inhibitory complex, triggering translation of target mRNAs and shifting CYFIP1 into the WAVE regulatory complex. Active Rac1 alters the CYFIP1 conformation, as demonstrated by intramolecular FRET, and is key in changing the equilibrium of the two complexes. CYFIP1 thus orchestrates the two molecular cascades, protein translation and actin polymerization, each of which is necessary for correct spine morphology in neurons. The CYFIP1 interactome reveals many interactors associated with brain disorders, opening new perspectives to define regulatory pathways shared by neurological disabilities characterized by spine dysmorphogenesis.          
24065579	Think about it: FMR1 gene mosaicism.         fragile X syndrome, intellectual disability, mosaicism Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation, intellectual disability, and autism. Most cases are the result of an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene and the subsequent functional loss of the related protein. We describe the case of a 4-year-old boy who clinically presents mild psychomotor delay without any major clinical dysmorphisms. Molecular analysis of the FMR1 gene showed mosaicism in terms of size and methylation, with one normal and 1 fully mutated allele, which is very rare in this syndrome. Physicians should therefore consider a diagnosis of FXS even if the patient's phenotype is mild. Although rare, diagnosing this condition has important consequences for the patient's rehabilitation and the family planning of parents and relatives.           
12238024	[Genetic study of 20 patients with autism disorders].          Many observations indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the aetiology of autism. Up to now, however, no genetic markers have been convincingly identified which influence the predisposition to this disorder. Complex genetic analysis of autistic patients and their families may therefore lead to the identification of features which could help to direct further search for the predisposing genes.          
21617890	FMR1 premutation and full mutation molecular mechanisms related to autism.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (>200 repeats) in the 5' un-translated portion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) leading to a deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of a number of other genes that are important for synaptic development and plasticity. Furthermore, many of these genes, when mutated, have been linked to autism in the general population, which may explain the high comorbidity that exists between FXS and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to ASD through a different molecular mechanism that involves a direct toxic effect of FMR1 mRNA. It is believed that RNA toxicity underlies much of the premutation-related involvement, including developmental concerns like autism, as well as neurodegenerative issues with aging such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). RNA toxicity can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is common in older premutation carriers both with and without FXTAS. Many of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in idiopathic autism. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems caused by the lack of FMRP in FXS, including metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5 (mGluR1/5) pathway and GABA pathways, has led to new targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.        
21648356	Fragile X-premutation tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in a young woman: clinical, genetics, MRI and 1H-MR spectroscopy correlates.          It is generally thought that fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) represents a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder occuring in male carriers of a premutation expansion (55-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR 1) gene. However, several female patients with FXTAS have also been reported recently. Here, we describe a 23-year old woman with positive family history of mental retardation and autism who presented clinically with action tremor, ataxia, emotional disturbances and cognitive dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed diffuse cortical atrophy, while 1H-MR spectroscopy (MRS) revealed decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and pons. Genetic testing confirmed heterozygous FMR 1 gene premutation of 100 CGG repeats in the abnormal allele and 29 CGG repeats in the normal allele. We concluded that FXTAS may be an under-recognized disorder, particularly in women.        
19016890	Social approach in genetically engineered mouse lines relevant to autism.          Profound impairment in social interaction is a core symptom of autism, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Deficits can include a lack of interest in social contact and low levels of approach and proximity to other children. In this study, a three-chambered choice task was used to evaluate sociability and social novelty preference in five lines of mice with mutations in genes implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Fmr1(tm1Cgr/Y)(Fmr1(-/y)) mice represent a model for fragile X, a mental retardation syndrome that is partially comorbid with autism. We tested Fmr1(-/y)mice on two genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6J and FVB/N-129/OlaHsd (FVB/129). Targeted disruption of Fmr1 resulted in low sociability on one measure, but only when the mutation was expressed on FVB/129. Autism has been associated with altered serotonin levels and polymorphisms in SLC6A4 (SERT), the serotonin transporter gene. Male mice with targeted disruption of Slc6a4 displayed significantly less sociability than wild-type controls. Mice with conditional overexpression of Igf-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) offered a model for brain overgrowth associated with autism. Igf-1 transgenic mice engaged in levels of social approach similar to wild-type controls. Targeted disruption in other genes of interest, En2 (engrailed-2) and Dhcr7, was carried on genetic backgrounds that showed low levels of exploration in the choice task, precluding meaningful interpretations of social behavior scores. Overall, results show that loss of Fmr1 or Slc6a4 gene function can lead to deficits in sociability. Findings from the fragile X model suggest that the FVB/129 background confers enhanced susceptibility to consequences of Fmr1 mutation on social approach.        
29771335	Loss of fragile X protein FMRP impairs homeostatic synaptic downscaling through tumor suppressor p53 and ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4-2.          Synaptic scaling allows neurons to homeostatically readjust synaptic strength upon chronic neural activity perturbations. Although altered synaptic scaling has been implicated to underlie imbalanced brain excitability in neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy, the molecular dysregulation and restoration of synaptic scaling in those diseases have not been demonstrated. Here, we showed that the homeostatic synaptic downscaling is absent in the hippocampal neurons of Fmr1 KO mice, the mouse model of the most common inherited autism, fragile X syndrome (FXS). We found that the impaired homeostatic synaptic downscaling in Fmr1 KO neurons is caused by loss-of-function dephosphorylation of an epilepsy-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-2, Nedd4-2. Such dephosphorylation of Nedd4-2 is surprisingly caused by abnormally stable tumor suppressor p53 and subsequently destabilized kinase Akt. Dephosphorylated Nedd4-2 fails to elicit 14-3-3-dependent ubiquitination and down-regulation of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptor, and therefore impairs synaptic downscaling. Most importantly, using a pharmacological inhibitor of p53, Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, GluA1 ubiquitination and synaptic downscaling are all restored in Fmr1 KO neurons. Together, our results discover a novel cellular mechanism underlying synaptic downscaling, and demonstrate the dysregulation and successful restoration of this mechanism in the FXS mouse model.        
29775702	Abnormal Sleep Architecture and Hippocampal Circuit Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.         Fmr1 knockout mouse, Fragile X syndrome, Gamma, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell, sharp-wave ripple, sleep architecture Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. The Fmr1 null mouse models much of the human disease including hyperarousal, sensory hypersensitivity, seizure activity, and hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairment. Sleep architecture is disorganized in FXS patients, but has not been examined in Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mice. Hippocampal neural activity during sleep, which is implicated in memory processing, also remains uninvestigated in Fmr1-KO mice. We performed in vivo electrophysiological studies of freely behaving Fmr1-KO mice to assess neural activity, in the form of single-unit spiking and local field potential (LFP), within the hippocampal CA1 region during multiple differentiated sleep and wake states. Here, we demonstrate that Fmr1-KO mice exhibited a deficit in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) due to a reduction in the frequency of bouts of REM, consistent with sleep architecture abnormalities of FXS patients. Fmr1-KO CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1-PCs) were hyperactive in all sleep and wake states. Increased low gamma power in CA1 suggests that this hyperactivity was related to increased input to CA1 from CA3. By contrast, slower sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs) in Fmr1-KO mice exhibited longer event duration, slower oscillation frequency, with reduced CA1-PC firing rates during SWRs, yet the incidence rate of SWRs remained intact. These results suggest abnormal neuronal activity in the Fmr1-KO mouse during SWRs, and hyperactivity during other wake and sleep states, with likely adverse consequences for memory processes.          
28504725	Metformin ameliorates core deficits in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in FMR1 abolish FMRP expression, leading to hyperactivation of ERK and mTOR signaling upstream of mRNA translation. Here we show that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2 diabetes, rescues core phenotypes in Fmr1        -/y mice and selectively normalizes ERK signaling, eIF4E phosphorylation and the expression of MMP-9. Thus, metformin is a potential FXS therapeutic.
27186135	Progress toward therapeutic potential for AFQ056 in Fragile X syndrome.         AFQ056, FMR1, Fmr1 knockout mouse, Fragile X mental retardation protein, Fragile X syndrome, group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the leading single-gene cause of autism. It is caused by the lack of production of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), resulting in cognitive deficits, hyperactivity, and autistic behaviors. Breakthrough advances in potential therapy for FXS followed the discovery that aberrant group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling is an important constituent of the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Research has indicated that upon neuronal stimulation, FMRP acts downstream of group 1 mGluRs (mGluRs1/5) to inhibit protein synthesis, long-term depression, and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor internalization. To offset the deficits caused by the lack of FMRP, many pharmaceutical companies have designed medicinal drugs to target the unrestrained stimulation of mGluR5 signaling in FXS. Indeed, promising results from animal and clinical studies suggest that mGluR5 antagonists such as AFQ056 can successfully correct many of the deficits in FXS. In this review, we cover the animal studies performed to date that test the role of AFQ056 as a selective mGluR5 antagonist to alleviate the phenotypes of FXS.         
22817866	Activation of 5-HT7 serotonin receptors reverses metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in wild-type and Fmr1 knockout mice, a model of Fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mice, an animal model of FXS, exhibit spatial memory impairment and synapse malfunctioning in the hippocampus, with abnormal enhancement of long-term depression mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-LTD). The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) modulates hippocampal-dependent learning through serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) and serotonin 7 (5-HT7) receptors; the underlying mechanisms are unknown.          
22842191	15q11.2 microdeletion and FMR1 premutation in a family with intellectual disabilities and autism.          Genomic rearrangements of chromosome 15q11-q13 are responsible for diverse phenotypes including intellectual disabilities and autism. 15q11.2 deletion, implicating common PWS/AS breakpoints BP1-BP2, has been described in patients with delayed motor and speech development and behavioural problems. Here we report the clinical and molecular characterisation of a maternally inherited BP1-BP2 deletion in two siblings with intellectual, motor and speech delay, autistic syndrome disorder and several dysmorphic features. One of the patients was also a carrier of an FMR1 allele in the low premutation range. The four genes within the deletion were under-expressed in all deletion carriers but FMR1 mRNA levels remained normal. Our results suggest that BP1-BP2 deletion could be considered as a risk factor for neuropsychological phenotypes and that it presents with variable clinical expressivity.          
18829439	Quantitative proteomic analysis of primary neurons reveals diverse changes in synaptic protein content in fmr1 knockout mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited form of mental retardation that is caused, in the vast majority of cases, by the transcriptional silencing of a single gene, fmr1. The encoded protein, FMRP, regulates mRNA translation in neuronal dendrites, and it is thought that changes in translation-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity lead to many symptoms of FXS. However, little is known about the potentially extensive changes in synaptic protein content that accompany loss of FMRP. Here, we describe the development of a high-throughput quantitative proteomic method to identify differences in synaptic protein expression between wild-type and fmr1-/- mouse cortical neurons. The method is based on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), which has been used to characterize differentially expressed proteins in dividing cells, but not in terminally differentiated cells because of reduced labeling efficiency. To address the issue of incomplete labeling, we developed a mathematical method to normalize protein ratios relative to a reference based on the labeling efficiency. Using this approach, in conjunction with multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), we identified >100 proteins that are up- or down-regulated. These proteins fall into a variety of functional categories, including those regulating synaptic structure, neurotransmission, dendritic mRNA transport, and several proteins implicated in epilepsy and autism, two endophenotypes of FXS. These studies provide insights into the potential origins of synaptic abnormalities in FXS and a demonstration of a methodology that can be used to explore neuronal protein changes in neurological disorders.        
30523064	Dendritic spines in early postnatal Fragile X mice are insensitive to novel sensory experience.          Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often associated with atypical sensory processing and sensory hypersensitivity, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors, such as tactile defensiveness. Such altered sensory perception in ASD could arise from disruptions in experience-dependent maturation of circuits during early brain development. Here, we tested the hypothesis that synaptic structures of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is a common inherited cause of autism, are not modulated by novel sensory information during development. We used chronic           in vivo two-photon microscopy to image dendritic spines and axon 'en passant' boutons (EPB) of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in S1 of male and female wild type (WT) and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a model of FXS. We found that a brief (overnight) exposure to dramatically enhanced sensory inputs in the second postnatal week led to a significant increase in spine density in WT mice, but not in Fmr1 KO mice. In contrast, axon EPB dynamics were impervious to this novel sensory experience in mice of both genotypes. We surmise that the inability of Fmr1 KO mice to modulate post-synaptic dynamics in response to increased sensory input, at a time when sensory information processing first comes online in S1 cortex, could play a role in altered sensory processing in FXS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVery few longitudinal in vivo imaging studies have investigated synaptic structure and dynamics in early postnatal mice. Moreover, those studies tend to focus on the effects of sensory input deprivation, a process that rarely occurs during normal brain development. Early postnatal imaging experiments are critical because a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, including those characterized by autism, could result from alterations in how circuits are shaped by incoming sensory inputs during critical periods of development. In this study, we focused on a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome and demonstrate how dendritic spines are insensitive to a brief period of novel sensory experience.
22265702	Minocycline treatment reverses ultrasonic vocalization production deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, with behaviors characteristic of autism. Symptoms include abnormal social behavior, repetitive behavior, communication disorders, and seizures. Many symptoms of FXS have been replicated in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. Whether Fmr1 KO mice exhibit vocal communication deficits is not known. By recording ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) produced by adult male mice during mating, we show that USV calling rate (number of calls/second) is reduced in Fmr1 KO mice compared to WT controls. The WT control and Fmr1 KO groups did not differ in other aspects of mating behavior such as time spent sniffing, mounting, rooting and without contact. Acoustic properties of calls such as mean frequency (in kHz), duration and dynamic range of frequencies were not different. This indicates a specific deficit in USV calling rate in Fmr1 KO mice. Previous studies have shown that treatment of Fmr1 KO mice with minocycline for 4weeks from birth can alleviate some behavioral symptoms. Here we tested if minocycline also reversed vocalization deficits in these mice. Calling rate increased and was similar to WT controls in adult Fmr1 KO mice treated with minocycline for four weeks from birth (P0-P28). All acoustic properties measured were similar in treated and untreated WT control mice indicating minocycline effects were specific to vocalizations in the Fmr1 KO mice. These data suggest that mating-related USVs are robust and relevant biomarkers of FXS, and that minocycline treatment is a promising avenue for treatment of FXS symptoms.          
22267161	Disrupted Homer scaffolds mediate abnormal mGluR5 function in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor subunit 5 (mGluR5) function is causally associated with the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, a leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. Here we provide evidence that altered mGluR5-Homer scaffolds contribute to mGluR5 dysfunction and phenotypes in the fragile X syndrome mouse model, Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1(-/y)). In Fmr1(-/y) mice, mGluR5 was less associated with long Homer isoforms but more associated with the short Homer1a. Genetic deletion of Homer1a restored mGluR5-long Homer scaffolds and corrected several phenotypes in Fmr1(-/y) mice, including altered mGluR5 signaling, neocortical circuit dysfunction and behavior. Acute, peptide-mediated disruption of mGluR5-Homer scaffolds in wild-type mice mimicked many Fmr1(-/y) phenotypes. In contrast, Homer1a deletion did not rescue altered mGluR-dependent long-term synaptic depression or translational control of target mRNAs of fragile X mental retardation protein, the gene product of Fmr1. Our findings reveal new functions for mGluR5-Homer interactions in the brain and delineate distinct mechanisms of mGluR5 dysfunction in a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction and autism.        
22268788	Altered mTOR signaling and enhanced CYFIP2 expression levels in subjects with fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism. The protein (FMRP) encoded by the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1), is an RNA-binding protein linked to translational control. Recently, in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of FXS, dysregulated translation initiation signaling was observed. To investigate whether an altered signaling was also a feature of subjects with FXS compared to typical developing controls, we isolated total RNA and translational control proteins from lymphocytes of subjects from both groups (38 FXS and 14 TD). Although we did not observe any difference in the expression level of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for translational initiation control proteins isolated from participant with FXS, we found increased phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) substrate, p70 ribosomal subunit 6 kinase1 (S6K1) and of the mTOR regulator, the serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt), in their protein lysates. In addition, we observed increased phosphorylation of the cap binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) suggesting that protein synthesis is upregulated in FXS. Similar to the findings in lymphocytes, we observed increased phosphorylation of S6K1 in brain tissue from patients with FXS (n = 4) compared to normal age-matched controls (n = 4). Finally, we detected increased expression of the cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2), a known FMRP interactor. This data verify and extend previous findings using lymphocytes for studies of neuropsychiatric disorders and provide evidence that misregulation of mTOR signaling observed in the FXS mouse model also occurs in human FXS and may provide useful biomarkers for designing targeted treatments in FXS.          
24564913	Divergent dysregulation of gene expression in murine models of fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis.          Fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis are genetic syndromes that both have a high rate of comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Several lines of evidence suggest that these two monogenic disorders may converge at a molecular level through the dysfunction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.          
16639106	Recent advances in fragile X: a model for autism and neurodegeneration.          This review will describe recent developments in the neurobiology of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the association between FXS and autism, and involvement in premutation carriers.          
20843831	The distribution of repressive histone modifications on silenced FMR1 alleles provides clues to the mechanism of gene silencing in fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and the most common known cause of autism. Most cases of FXS result from the expansion of a CGG·CCG repeat in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene that leads to gene silencing. It has previously been shown that silenced alleles are associated with histone H3 dimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9Me2) and H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27Me3), modified histones typical of developmentally repressed genes. We show here that these alleles are also associated with elevated levels of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9Me3) and histone H4 trimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20Me3). All four of these modified histones are present on exon 1 of silenced alleles at levels comparable to that seen on pericentric heterochromatin. The two groups of histone modifications show a different distribution on fragile X alleles: H3K9Me2 and H3K27Me3 have a broad distribution, whereas H3K9Me3 and H4K20Me3 have a more focal distribution with the highest level of these marks being present in the vicinity of the repeat. This suggests that the trigger for gene silencing may be local to the repeat itself and perhaps involves a mechanism similar to that involved in the formation of pericentric heterochromatin.        
20858229	Fragile X and autism: Intertwined at the molecular level leading to targeted treatments.           Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (> 200 repeats) in the 5' untranslated portion of the fragile mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), leading to deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA carrier protein that controls the translation of several other genes that regulate synaptic development and plasticity. Autism occurs in approximately 30% of FXS cases, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) occurs in an additional 30% of cases. Premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including both autism and PDD-NOS, through a different molecular mechanism that involves a direct toxic effect of the expanded CGG repeat FMR1 mRNA. RNA toxicity can also lead to aging effects including tremor, ataxia and cognitive decline, termed fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in premutation carriers in late life. In studies of mice bearing premutation expansions, there is evidence of early postnatal neuronal cell toxicity, presenting as reduced cell longevity, decreased dendritic arborization and altered synaptic morphology. There is also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in premutation carriers. Many of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in autism without fragile X mutations. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems in FXS, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)1/5 pathway and γ aminobutyric acid (GABA)A pathways, have led to new targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.        
20859177	ACOG Committee Opinion No. 469: Carrier screening for fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. The syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 3,600 males and 1 in 4,000-6,000 females. Approximately 1 in 250 females carry the premutation. DNA-based molecular analysis is the preferred method of diagnosis for fragile X syndrome and its premutations. Prenatal testing for fragile X syndrome should be offered to known carriers of the fragile X premutation or full mutation. Women with a family history of fragile X-related disorders, unexplained mental retardation or developmental delay, autism, or premature ovarian insufficiency are candidates for genetic counseling and fragile X premutation carrier screening.        
18057320	FMR1 CGG repeat length predicts motor dysfunction in premutation carriers.          Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently described, underrecognized neurodegenerative disorder of aging fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation carriers, particularly men. Core motor features are action tremor, gait ataxia, and parkinsonism. Carriers have expanded CGG repeats (55 to 200); larger expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable cause of mental retardation and autism. This study determines whether CGG repeat length correlates with severity and type of motor dysfunction in premutation carriers.          
26475977	Epigenetic modifications in human fragile X pluripotent stem cells; Implications in fragile X syndrome modeling.         FXS human embryonic stem cells, FXS induced pluripotent stem cells, Fragile X syndrome Patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS) exhibit moderate to severe intellectual disabilities. In addition, one-third of FXS patients show characteristics of autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion, which leads to silencing of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene. The absence of the FMR1 gene product, FMRP, is the reason for the disease symptoms. It has been suggested that repeat instability and transcription of the FMR1 gene occur during early embryonic development, while after cell differentiation repeats become stable and the FMR1 gene is silent. Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, are associated with gene silencing and repeat stability at the FMR1 locus. However, the mechanisms leading to gene silencing and repeat expansion are still ambiguous, because studies at the human genomic locus were limited until now. The FXS pluripotent stem cells, recently derived from FXS adult cells and FXS blastocysts, are new useful tools to examine these mechanisms at the human endogenous FMR1 locus. This review summarizes the epigenetic features and experimental studies of FXS human embryonic and FXS induced pluripotent stem cells, generated so far. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Exploiting human neurons.          
27957526	Mammalian FMRP S499 Is Phosphorylated by CK2 and Promotes Secondary Phosphorylation of FMRP.         FMRP, casein kinase, fragile X, mTOR, phosphorylation, translation The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA-binding regulator of protein translation that associates with 4-6% of brain transcripts and is central to neurodevelopment. Autism risk genes' transcripts are overrepresented among FMRP-binding mRNAs, and FMRP loss-of-function mutations are responsible for fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of monogenetic autism. It is thought that FMRP-dependent translational repression is governed by the phosphorylation of serine residue 499 (S499). However, recent evidence suggests that S499 phosphorylation is not modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptor class I (mGluR-I) or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), two molecules shown to regulate FMRP translational repression. Moreover, the mammalian FMRP S499 kinase remains unknown. We found that casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylates murine FMRP S499. Further, we show that phosphorylation of FMRP S499 permits phosphorylation of additional, nearby residues. Evidence suggests that these nearby residues are modulated by mGluR-I and PP2A pathways. These data support an alternative phosphodynamic model of FMRP that is harmonious with prior studies and serves as a framework for further investigation.        
18784272	Imbalance of neocortical excitation and inhibition and altered UP states reflect network hyperexcitability in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Despite the pronounced neurological deficits associated with mental retardation and autism, it is unknown if altered neocortical circuit function occurs in these prevalent disorders. Here we demonstrate specific alterations in local synaptic connections, membrane excitability, and circuit activity of defined neuron types in sensory neocortex of the mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome-the Fmr1 knockout (KO). Overall, these alterations result in hyperexcitability of neocortical circuits in the Fmr1 KO. Specifically, we observe a substantial deficit in local excitatory drive ( approximately 50%) targeting fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons in layer 4 of somatosensory, barrel cortex. This persists until at least 4 wk of age suggesting it may be permanent. In contrast, monosynaptic GABAergic synaptic transmission was unaffected. Overall, these changes indicate that local feedback inhibition in neocortical layer 4 is severely impaired in the Fmr1 KO mouse. An increase in the intrinsic membrane excitability of excitatory neurons may further contribute to hyperexcitability of cortical networks. In support of this idea, persistent neocortical circuit activity, or UP states, elicited by thalamic stimulation was longer in duration in the Fmr1 KO mouse. In addition, network inhibition during the UP state was less synchronous, including a 14% decrease in synchrony in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz). These circuit changes may be involved in sensory stimulus hypersensitivity, epilepsy, and cognitive impairment associated with Fragile X and autism.        
16201716	Fragile X syndrome: a clinico-genetic study of mentally retarded patients in Kuwait.          In a prospective study in Kuwait, 182 mentally retarded male patients who fulfilled 5 or more clinical criteria of fragile X syndrome were screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Twenty patients (11%) were highly suspected of having fragile X syndrome due to mutation at the FRAXA locus; none had mutation at the FRAXE locus. Of these, 11 (55%) were confirmed fragile-X-positive by both cytogenetic and PCR techniques. The most frequent clinical features were: prominent forehead, high arched palate, hyperextensible joints, long ears, prominent jaw, height > 10th centile and attention-deficit hyperactivity. Less common were avoidance of eye contact (45%), autism (45%) and seizures (30%). Large testes were found in 55% of cases. Pre-pubertal and post-pubertal clinical criteria were different.        
28572606	Automated screening for Fragile X premutation carriers based on linguistic and cognitive computational phenotypes.          Millions of people globally are at high risk for neurodegenerative disorders, infertility or having children with a disability as a result of the Fragile X (FX) premutation, a genetic abnormality in FMR1 that is underdiagnosed. Despite the high prevalence of the FX premutation and its effect on public health and family planning, most FX premutation carriers are unaware of their condition. Since genetic testing for the premutation is resource intensive, it is not practical to screen individuals for FX premutation status using genetic testing. In a novel approach to phenotyping, we have utilized audio recordings and cognitive profiling assessed via self-administered questionnaires on 200 females. Machine-learning methods were developed to discriminate FX premutation carriers from mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders, the comparison group. By using a random forest classifier, FX premutation carriers could be identified in an automated fashion with high precision and recall (0.81 F1 score). Linguistic and cognitive phenotypes that were highly associated with FX premutation carriers were high language dysfluency, poor ability to organize material, and low self-monitoring. Our framework sets the foundation for computational phenotyping strategies to pre-screen large populations for this genetic variant with nominal costs.        
26640241	Human pluripotent stem cell models of Fragile X syndrome.         Autism, Epigenetics, FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, Human, Neural development, Pluripotent stem cells Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. The causal mutation in FXS is a trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene that leads to human specific epigenetic silencing and loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) expression. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and particularly induced PSCs (iPSCs), offer a model system to reveal cellular and molecular events underlying human neuronal development and function in FXS. Human FXS PSCs have been established and have provided insight into the epigenetic silencing of the FMR1 gene as well as aspects of neuronal development.          
26663181	microRNAs and Fragile X Syndrome.         FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, RITS, RNAi, microRNA Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the major causes for autism and mental retardation in humans. The etiology of FXS is linked to the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeats, r(CGG), suppressing the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome, resulting in a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression, which is required for regulating normal neuronal connectivity and plasticity. Recent studies have further identified that microRNAs are involved in the mechanisms underlying FXS pathogenesis at three different developmental stages. During early embryogenesis before the blastocyst stage, an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific microRNA, miR-302, interferes with FMR1 mRNA translation to maintain the stem cell status and inhibit neural development. After blastocyst, the downregulation of miR-302 releases FMRP synthesis and subsequently leads to neuronal development; yet, in FXS, certain r(CGG)-derived microRNAs, such as miR-fmr1s, are expressed and accumulated and then induce DNA hypermethylation on the FMR1 gene promoter regions, resulting in transcriptional inactivation of the FMR1 gene and the loss of FMRP. In normal neuronal development, FMRP is an RNA-binding protein responsible for interacting with miR-125 and miR-132 to regulate the signaling of Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), respectively, and consequently affecting synaptic plasticity. As a result, the loss of FMRP impairs these signaling controls and eventually causes FXS-associated disorders, such as autism and mental retardation. Based on these current findings, this chapter will summarize the etiological causes of FXS and further provides significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying microRNA-mediated FXS pathogenesis and the related therapy development.         
29106525	Loss of Drosophila FMRP leads to alterations in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most prevalent form of inherited intellectual disability and the foremost monogenetic cause of autism, is caused by loss of expression of the FMR1 gene . Here, we show that dfmr1 modulates the global metabolome in Drosophila. Despite our previous discovery of increased brain insulin signaling, our results indicate that dfmr1 mutants have reduced carbohydrate and lipid stores and are hypersensitive to starvation stress. The observed metabolic deficits cannot be explained by feeding behavior, as we report that dfmr1 mutants are hyperphagic. Rather, our data identify dfmr1 as a regulator of mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that under supersaturating conditions, dfmr1 mutant mitochondria have significantly increased maximum electron transport system (ETS) capacity. Moreover, electron micrographs of indirect flight muscle reveal striking morphological changes in the dfmr1 mutant mitochondria. Taken together, our results illustrate the importance of dfmr1 for proper maintenance of nutrient homeostasis and mitochondrial function.          
29112191	Identifying specific prefrontal neurons that contribute to autism-associated abnormalities in physiology and social behavior.          Functional imaging and gene expression studies both implicate the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), particularly deep-layer projection neurons, as a potential locus for autism pathology. Here, we explored how specific deep-layer prefrontal neurons contribute to abnormal physiology and behavior in mouse models of autism. First, we find that across three etiologically distinct models-in utero valproic acid (VPA) exposure, CNTNAP2 knockout and FMR1 knockout-layer 5 subcortically projecting (SC) neurons consistently exhibit reduced input resistance and action potential firing. To explore how altered SC neuron physiology might impact behavior, we took advantage of the fact that in deep layers of the mPFC, dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) are mainly expressed by SC neurons, and used D2-Cre mice to label D2R+ neurons for calcium imaging or optogenetics. We found that social exploration preferentially recruits mPFC D2R+ cells, but that this recruitment is attenuated in VPA-exposed mice. Stimulating mPFC D2R+ neurons disrupts normal social interaction. Conversely, inhibiting these cells enhances social behavior in VPA-exposed mice. Importantly, this effect was not reproduced by nonspecifically inhibiting mPFC neurons in VPA-exposed mice, or by inhibiting D2R+ neurons in wild-type mice. These findings suggest that multiple forms of autism may alter the physiology of specific deep-layer prefrontal neurons that project to subcortical targets. Furthermore, a highly overlapping population-prefrontal D2R+ neurons-plays an important role in both normal and abnormal social behavior, such that targeting these cells can elicit potentially therapeutic effects.        
29114038	Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene           FMR1 on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with abnormal dendritic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of Fmr1-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine morphology and spine density associated with FXS.
29114037	Reducing eIF4E-eIF4G interactions restores the balance between protein synthesis and actin dynamics in fragile X syndrome model mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by silencing of the           FMR1 gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding protein that represses the translation of its target mRNAs. One mechanism by which FMRP represses translation is through its association with cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which subsequently sequesters and inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). CYFIP1 shuttles between the FMRP-eIF4E complex and the Rac1-Wave regulatory complex, thereby connecting translational regulation to actin dynamics and dendritic spine morphology, which are dysregulated in FXS model mice that lack FMRP. Treating FXS mice with 4EGI-1, which blocks interactions between eIF4E and eIF4G, a critical interaction partner for translational initiation, reversed defects in hippocampus-dependent memory and spine morphology. We also found that 4EGI-1 normalized the phenotypes of enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated long-term depression (LTD), enhanced Rac1-p21-activated kinase (PAK)-cofilin signaling, altered actin dynamics, and dysregulated CYFIP1/eIF4E and CYFIP1/Rac1 interactions in FXS mice. Our findings are consistent with the idea that an imbalance in protein synthesis and actin dynamics contributes to pathophysiology in FXS mice, and suggest that targeting eIF4E may be a strategy for treating FXS.
29116166	Multiple Behavior Phenotypes of the Fragile-X Syndrome Mouse Model Respond to Chronic Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D).          Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) patients display intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder due to silencing of the X-linked, fragile-X mental retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. Dysregulation of cAMP metabolism is a consistent finding in patients and in the mouse and fly FXS models. We therefore explored if BPN14770, a prototypic phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator (PDE4D-NAM) in early human clinical trials, might provide therapeutic benefit in the mouse FXS model. Daily treatment of adult male fmr1 C57Bl6 knock-out mice with BPN14770 for 14 days reduced hyperarousal, improved social interaction, and improved natural behaviors such as nesting and marble burying as well as dendritic spine morphology. There was no decrement in behavioral scores in control C57Bl6 treated with BPN14770. The behavioral benefit of BPN14770 persisted two weeks after washout of the drug. Thus, BPN14770 may be useful for the treatment of fragile-X syndrome and other disorders with decreased cAMP signaling.        
29133950	Treating a novel plasticity defect rescues episodic memory in Fragile X model mice.          Episodic memory, a fundamental component of human cognition, is significantly impaired in autism. We believe we report the first evidence for this problem in the Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse model of Fragile X syndrome and describe potentially treatable underlying causes. The hippocampus is critical for the formation and use of episodes, with semantic (cue identity) information relayed to the structure via the lateral perforant path (LPP). The unusual form of synaptic plasticity expressed by the LPP (lppLTP) was profoundly impaired in Fmr1-KOs relative to wild-type mice. Two factors contributed to this defect: (i) reduced GluN1 subunit levels in synaptic NMDA receptors and related currents, and (ii) impaired retrograde synaptic signaling by the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Studies using a novel serial cue paradigm showed that episodic encoding is dependent on both the LPP and the endocannabinoid receptor CB        1, and is strikingly impaired in Fmr1-KOs. Enhancing 2-AG signaling rescued both lppLTP and learning in the mutants. Thus, two consequences of the Fragile-X mutation converge on plasticity at one site in hippocampus to prevent encoding of a basic element of cognitive memory. Collectively, the results suggest a clinically plausible approach to treatment.
15219735	The mGluR theory of fragile X mental retardation.          Many of the diverse functional consequences of activating group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors require translation of pre-existing mRNA near synapses. One of these consequences is long-term depression (LTD) of transmission at hippocampal synapses. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the defect responsible for fragile X syndrome in humans, increases LTD in mouse hippocampus. This finding is consistent with the growing evidence that FMRP normally functions as a repressor of translation of specific mRNAs. Here we present a theory that can account for diverse neurological and psychiatric aspects of fragile X syndrome, based on the assumption that many of the protein-synthesis-dependent functions of metabotropic receptors are exaggerated in fragile X syndrome. The theory suggests new directions for basic research as well as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of humans with fragile X, the most frequent inherited cause of mental retardation and an identified cause of autism.        
19724010	Fragile X syndrome: from molecular genetics to therapy.          Fragile X syndrome, the main cause of inherited mental retardation, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation gene, FMR1. Absence of the associated protein FMRP leads to the dysregulation of many genes creating a phenotype of ADHD, anxiety, epilepsy and autism. The core aim of this review is to summarise two decades of molecular research leading to the characterisation of cellular and molecular pathways involved in the pathology of this disease and as a consequence to the identification of two new promising targets for rational therapy of fragile X syndrome, namely the group 1 metabotrope glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs) and the gamma-amino butyric acid A receptors (GABA(A)Rs). As no current clinical treatments are directed specifically at the underlying neuronal defect due to absence of FMRP, this might open new powerful therapeutic strategies.        
19738924	Temporal requirements of the fragile x mental retardation protein in modulating circadian clock circuit synaptic architecture.         Drosophila, FMRP, clock circuit, fragile X syndrome, gene-switch, lateral neuron, pigment dispersing factor, synapse Loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene function is the most common cause of inherited mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders, characterized by attention disorder, hyperactivity and disruption of circadian activity cycles. Pursuit of effective intervention strategies requires determining when the FMR1 product (FMRP) is required in the regulation of neuronal circuitry controlling these behaviors. In the well-characterized Drosophila disease model, loss of the highly conserved dFMRP causes circadian arrhythmicity and conspicuous abnormalities in the circadian clock circuitry. Here, a novel Sholl Analysis was used to quantify over-elaborated synaptic architecture in dfmr1-null small ventrolateral neurons (sLN(v)s), a key subset of clock neurons. The transgenic Gene-Switch system was employed to drive conditional neuronal dFMRP expression in the dfmr1-null mutant background in order to dissect temporal requirements within the clock circuit. Introduction of dFMRP during early brain development, including the stages of neurogenesis, neuronal fate specification and early pathfinding, provided no rescue of dfmr1 mutant phenotypes. Similarly, restoring normal dFMRP expression in the adult failed to restore circadian circuit architecture. In sharp contrast, supplying dFMRP during a transient window of very late brain development, wherein synaptogenesis and substantial subsequent synaptic reorganization (e.g. use-dependent pruning) occur, provided strong morphological rescue to reestablish normal sLN(v)s synaptic arbors. We conclude that dFMRP plays a developmentally restricted role in sculpting synaptic architecture in these neurons that cannot be compensated for by later reintroduction of the protein at maturity.        
21596027	"Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for programmed cell death and clearance of developmentally-transient peptidergic neurons.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene function, is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. The FMR1 product (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein best established to function in activity-dependent modulation of synaptic connections. In the Drosophila FXS disease model, loss of functionally-conserved dFMRP causes synaptic overgrowth and overelaboration in pigment dispersing factor (PDF) peptidergic neurons in the adult brain. Here, we identify a very different component of PDF neuron misregulation in dfmr1 mutants: the aberrant retention of normally developmentally-transient PDF tritocerebral (PDF-TRI) neurons. In wild-type animals, PDF-TRI neurons in the central brain undergo programmed cell death and complete, processive clearance within days of eclosion. In the absence of dFMRP, a defective apoptotic program leads to constitutive maintenance of these peptidergic neurons. We tested whether this apoptotic defect is circuit-specific by examining crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) and bursicon circuits, which are similarly developmentally-transient and normally eliminated immediately post-eclosion. In dfmr1 null mutants, CCAP/bursicon neurons also exhibit significantly delayed clearance dynamics, but are subsequently eliminated from the nervous system, in contrast to the fully persistent PDF-TRI neurons. Thus, the requirement of dFMRP for the retention of transitory peptidergic neurons shows evident circuit specificity. The novel defect of impaired apoptosis and aberrant neuron persistence in the Drosophila FXS model suggests an entirely new level of ""pruning"" dysfunction may contribute to the FXS disease state.          "
21596554	Drosophila modeling of heritable neurodevelopmental disorders.          Heritable neurodevelopmental disorders are multifaceted disease conditions encompassing a wide range of symptoms including intellectual disability, cognitive dysfunction, autism and myriad other behavioral impairments. In cases where single, causative genetic defects have been identified, such as Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Fragile X syndrome, the classical Drosophila genetic system has provided fruitful disease models. Recent Drosophila studies have advanced our understanding of UBE3A, MECP2, NF1 and FMR1 function, respectively, in genetic, biochemical, anatomical, physiological and behavioral contexts. Investigations in Drosophila continue to provide the essential mechanistic understanding required to facilitate the conception of rational therapeutic treatments.          
22522693	Systematic mapping of fragile X granules in the mouse brain reveals a potential role for presynaptic FMRP in sensorimotor functions.          Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism. Although the functions of FMRP and its homologs FXR1P and FXR2P are well studied in the somatodendritic domain, recent evidence suggests that this family of RNA binding proteins also plays a role in the axonal and presynaptic compartments. Fragile X granules (FXGs) are morphologically and genetically defined structures containing Fragile X proteins that are expressed axonally and presynaptically in a subset of circuits. To further understand the role of presynaptic Fragile X proteins in the brain, we systematically mapped the FXG distribution in the mouse central nervous system. This analysis revealed both the circuits and the neuronal types that express FXGs. FXGs are enriched in circuits that mediate sensory processing and motor planning-functions that are particularly perturbed in FXS patients. Analysis of FXG expression in the hippocampus suggests that CA3 pyramidal neurons use presynaptic Fragile X proteins to modulate recurrent but not feedforward processing. Neuron-specific FMRP mutants revealed a requirement for neuronal FMRP in the regulation of FXGs. Finally, conditional FMRP ablation demonstrated that FXGs are expressed in axons of thalamic relay nuclei that innervate cortex, but not in axons of thalamic reticular nuclei, striatal nuclei, or cortical neurons that innervate thalamus. Together, these findings support the proposal that dysregulation of axonal and presynaptic Fragile X proteins contribute to the neurological symptoms of FXS.          
22542183	De novo gene disruptions in children on the autistic spectrum.          Exome sequencing of 343 families, each with a single child on the autism spectrum and at least one unaffected sibling, reveal de novo small indels and point substitutions, which come mostly from the paternal line in an age-dependent manner. We do not see significantly greater numbers of de novo missense mutations in affected versus unaffected children, but gene-disrupting mutations (nonsense, splice site, and frame shifts) are twice as frequent, 59 to 28. Based on this differential and the number of recurrent and total targets of gene disruption found in our and similar studies, we estimate between 350 and 400 autism susceptibility genes. Many of the disrupted genes in these studies are associated with the fragile X protein, FMRP, reinforcing links between autism and synaptic plasticity. We find FMRP-associated genes are under greater purifying selection than the remainder of genes and suggest they are especially dosage-sensitive targets of cognitive disorders.          
22543975	Evaluation of copy number variations reveals novel candidate genes in autism spectrum disorder-associated pathways.          Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable, yet relatively few associated genetic loci have been replicated. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in autism; however, the majority of loci contribute to <1% of the disease population. Therefore, independent studies are important to refine associated CNV regions and discover novel susceptibility genes. In this study, a genome-wide SNP array was utilized for CNV detection by two distinct algorithms in a European ancestry case-control data set. We identify a significantly higher burden in the number and size of deletions, and disrupting more genes in ASD cases. Moreover, 18 deletions larger than 1 Mb were detected exclusively in cases, implicating novel regions at 2q22.1, 3p26.3, 4q12 and 14q23. Case-specific CNVs provided further evidence for pathways previously implicated in ASDs, revealing new candidate genes within the GABAergic signaling and neural development pathways. These include DBI, an allosteric binder of GABA receptors, GABARAPL1, the GABA receptor-associated protein, and SLC6A11, a postsynaptic GABA transporter. We also identified CNVs in COBL, deletions of which cause defects in neuronal cytoskeleton morphogenesis in model vertebrates, and DNER, a neuron-specific Notch ligand required for cerebellar development. Moreover, we found evidence of genetic overlap between ASDs and other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. These genes include glutamate receptors (GRID1, GRIK2 and GRIK4), synaptic regulators (NRXN3, SLC6A8 and SYN3), transcription factor (ZNF804A) and RNA-binding protein FMR1. Taken together, these CNVs may be a few of the missing pieces of ASD heritability and lead to discovering novel etiological mechanisms.        
29641418	[Fragile X syndrome and FMR1-dependent diseases - diagnostic scheme based on own experience .]          MS-MLPA, FMR1, PCR, TP-PCR, dynamic mutation The presence of dynamic mutation in the FMR1 gene localized on the X chromosome (Xq28) is the major cause of Fragile X syndrome. As this syndrome is quite frequently diagnosed in patients with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, the genetic testing of the FMR1 gene is a routine procedure performed in these patients. Molecular methods based on the PCR technique are used commonly, as they allow to identify normal (up to 54 CGG repeats, including grey zone alleles - 45-54 CGG repeats), premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) and full mutation (>200 CGG repeats) alleles.The article presents the basic methods used in the molecular diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome and other FMR1-related disorders. The following methods are presented: a screening test with GeneScan analysis, TP-PCR based tests and methods used for methylation analysis. Their pros and cons, as well as the resulting interpretation are discussed. Moreover, there is a presentation of the molecular diagnostic scheme following European Molecular Genetics Quality Network guidelines used in the Department of Medical Genetics.        
30084485	Epigenetics of fragile X syndrome and fragile X-related disorders.          The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1)-related disorder fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of cognitive impairment and the second most common cause of comorbid autism. FXS usually results when a premutation trinucleotide CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene (CGG 55-200) expands over generations to a full mutation allele (CGG >200). This expansion is associated with silencing of the FMR1 promoter via an epigenetic mechanism that involves DNA methylation of the CGG repeat and the surrounding regulatory regions. Decrease in FMR1 transcription is associated with loss of the FMR1 protein that is needed for typical brain development. The past decade has seen major advances in our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic processes that underlie FXS. Here we review these advances and their implications for diagnosis and treatment for individuals who have FMR1-related disorders.          
30087606	Are FXR Family Proteins Integrators of Dopamine Signaling and Glutamatergic Neurotransmission in Mental Illnesses?         dopamine signaling, fragile X proteins, glutamatergic neurotransmission, mood disorders, schizophrenia Dopamine receptors and related signaling pathways have long been implicated in pathophysiology and treatment of mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Dopamine signaling may impact neuronal activity by modulation of glutamate neurotransmission. Recent evidence indicates a direct and/or indirect involvement of fragile X-related family proteins (FXR) in the regulation and mediation of dopamine receptor functions. FXRs consists of fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (Fmr1/FMRP) and its autosomal homologs Fxr1 and Fxr2. These RNA-binding proteins are enriched in the brain. Loss of function mutation in human         FMR1 is the major genetic contributor to Fragile X mental retardation syndrome. Therefore, the role of FXR proteins has mostly been studied in the context of autism spectrum disorders. However, recent genome-wide association studies have linked this family to schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and mood regulation pointing toward a broader involvement in mental illnesses. FXR family proteins play an important role in the regulation of glutamate-mediated neuronal activity and plasticity. Here, we discuss the brain-specific functions of FXR family proteins by focusing on the regulation of dopamine receptor functions, ionotropic glutamate receptors-mediated synaptic plasticity and contribution to mental illnesses. Based on recent evidence, we propose that FXR proteins are potential integrators of dopamine signaling and ionotropic glutamate transmission.
21934270	Fragile X syndrome: the GABAergic system and circuit dysfunction.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, sensory hypersensitivity, and high incidences of autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. These phenotypes are suggestive of defects in neural circuit development and imbalances in excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. While alterations in excitatory synapse function and plasticity are well-established in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse models of FXS, a number of recent electrophysiological and molecular studies now identify prominent defects in inhibitory GABAergic transmission in behaviorally relevant forebrain regions such as the amygdala, cortex, and hippocampus. In this review, we summarize evidence for GABAergic system dysfunction in FXS patients and Fmr1 KO mouse models alike. We then discuss some of the known developmental roles of GABAergic signaling, as well as the development and refinement of GABAergic synapses as a framework for understanding potential causes of mature circuit dysfunction. Finally, we highlight the GABAergic system as a relevant target for the treatment of FXS.          
9118347	Point mutation analysis of the FMR-1 gene in autism.          We have analysed all 17 exons of the human FMR-1 gene for mutations in autistic individuals using single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We have identified three new polymorphisms. SSCP DNA fragment shifts were found for exons, 5, 10 and 11 in autistic individuals and in normal controls. Sequence analysis showed the exon 10 and 11 polymorphisms to result from base substitutions within introns, 14 and 73 bp downstream from the splice site respectively. In exon 5, a G to A base substitution at codon 138 has no effect on amino acid sequence. The intronic polymorphism adjacent to exon 10 was analysed amongst two groups of unrelated autistic individuals-one from the UK and one from Germany- and amongst a control population. Comparison of allele frequencies between Caucasian autism cases and Caucasian controls show a significant increase in the presence of the polymorphic intronic sequence 3' to exon 10 (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.01). The base change is at a position where it is unlikely to affect splicing of the FMR-1 transcript and is most likely a neutral variant that has only a spurious false positive association with autism. However further linkage disequilibrium analyses are justifiable. The positive association with autism should be explored in further samples to determine whether it has any validity as a genetic marker for autism.        
29178241	Rare FMR1 gene mutations causing fragile X syndrome: A review.         FMR1 gene, FMRP, fragile X syndrome, genetics, rare mutations, review Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, typically due to CGG-repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene leading to lack of expression. We identified a rare FMR1 gene mutation (c.413G>A), previously reported in a single patient and reviewed the literature for other rare FMR1 mutations. Our patient at 10 years of age presented with the classical findings of FXS including intellectual disability, autism, craniofacial findings, hyperextensibility, fleshy hands, flat feet, unsteady gait, and seizures but without the typical CGG-repeat expansion. He had more features of FXS than the previously reported patient with the same mutation. Twenty individuals reported previously with rare missense or nonsense mutations or other coding disturbances of the FMR1 gene ranged in age from infancy to 50 years; most were verbal with limited speech, had autism and hyperactivity, and all had intellectual disability. Four of the 20 individuals had a mutation within exon 15, three within exon 5, and two within exon 2. The FMR1 missense mutation (c.413G>A) is the same as in a previously reported male where it was shown that there was preservation of the post-synaptic function of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the encoded protein of the FMR1 gene was preserved. Both patients with this missense mutation had physical, cognitive, and behavioral features similarly seen in FXS.          
21328568	Behavioral profiles of mouse models for autism spectrum disorders.          Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in reciprocal social communication, and stereotyped verbal and nonverbal behaviors. In approximately 10-25% of the affected individuals, a genetic mutation associated with the condition can be identified. Recently, mutations altering synapse formation, cellular/synaptic growth rate and regulation of excitatory and inhibitory currents were identified in patients with intellectual disability, typical autism, Asperger syndrome or neurological syndromes associated with autistic traits. Following these genetic findings, mouse models carrying mutations similar to those identified in patients have been generated. These models offer the opportunity to investigate in vivo the physiological and behavioral consequences of the mutations. Here, we review the existing data on the phenotypes of mice carrying mutations in genes associated with ASD including neuroligin, neurexin and Shank mutant mice as well as the Fmr1, Mecp2, Ube3a, Nf1, Pten and Tsc1/Tsc2 mutant mice. The diversity and complexity of the phenotype of these mouse models reflect the broad range of phenotypes observed in patients with ASD. Remarkably, results from therapeutic approaches (e.g., modulation of gene expression, administration of pharmacological and nonpharmacological substances, enriched environment) are encouraging since some behavioral alterations could be reversed even when treatment was performed on adult mice. These ongoing studies should therefore increase our understanding of the biological alterations associated with ASD as well as the development of knowledge-based treatments.          
23885228	Towards identification of individual etiologies by resolving genomic and biological conundrums in patients with autism spectrum disorders.         Autism, Copy number variation, Personalized medicine, Polygenic mode, Single nucleotide variation, Transgenic mouse models Recent genomic research into autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has revealed a remarkably complex genetic architecture. Large numbers of common variants, copy number variations and single nucleotide variants have been identified, yet each of them individually afforded only a small phenotypic impact. A polygenic model in which multiple genes interact either in an additive or a synergistic way appears the most plausible for the majority of ASD patients. Based on recently identified ASD candidate genes, transgenic mouse models for neuroligins/neurorexins and genes such as Cntnap2, Cntn5, Tsc1, Tsc2, Akt3, Cyfip1, Scn1a, En2, Slc6a4, and Bckdk have been generated and studied with respect to behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotypes and sensitivity to drug treatments. From these models, a few clues for potential pharmacologic intervention emerged. The Fmr1, Shank2 and Cntn5 knockout mice exhibited alterations of glutamate receptors, which may become a target for pharmacologic modulation. Some of the phenotypes of Mecp2 knockout mice can be ameliorated by administering IGF1. In the near future, comprehensive genotyping of individual patients and siblings combined with the novel insights generated from the transgenic animal studies may provide us with personalized treatment options. Eventually, autism may indeed turn out to be a phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders ('autisms') caused by combinations of changes in multiple possible candidate genes, being different in each patient and requiring for each combination of mutations a distinct, individually tailored treatment.         
25956630	Protein expression of targets of the FMRP regulon is altered in brains of subjects with schizophrenia and mood disorders.         APP, RAC1, STEP, bipolar disorder, homer 1, schizophrenia Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA binding protein with 842 target mRNAs in mammalian brain. Silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene leads to loss of expression of FMRP and upregulated metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling resulting in the multiple physical and cognitive deficits associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Reduced FMRP expression has been identified in subjects with autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression who do not carry the mutation for FMR1. Our laboratory has recently demonstrated altered expression of four downstream targets of FMRP-mGluR5 signaling in brains of subjects with autism: homer 1, amyloid beta A4 precursor protein (APP), ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), and striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). In the current study we investigated the expression of the same four proteins in lateral cerebella of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression and in frontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In frontal cortex we observed: 1) reduced expression of 120 kDa form of APP in subjects with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; 2) reduced expression of 61 kDa and 33k Da forms of STEP in subjects with schizophrenia; 3) reduced expression of 88 kDa form of APP in subjects with bipolar disorder; and 3) trends for reduced expression of 88 kDa form of APP and homer 1 in subjects with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, respectively. In lateral cerebella there was no group difference, however we observed increased expression of RAC1 in subjects with bipolar disorder, and trends for increased RAC1 in subjects with schizophrenia and major depression. Our results provide further evidence that proteins involved in the FMRP-mGluR5 signaling pathway are altered in schizophrenia and mood disorders.          
26772998	Zfrp8 forms a complex with fragile-X mental retardation protein and regulates its localization and function.         FMRP, Trailer Hitch, Translational repression, Zfrp8 Fragile-X syndrome is the most commonly inherited cause of autism and mental disabilities. The Fmr1 (Fragile-X Mental Retardation 1) gene is essential in humans and Drosophila for the maintenance of neural stem cells, and Fmr1 loss results in neurological and reproductive developmental defects in humans and flies. FMRP (Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein) is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, involved in mRNA silencing and translational repression. Both Zfrp8 and Fmr1 have essential functions in the Drosophila ovary. In this study, we identified FMRP, Nufip (Nuclear Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein-interacting Protein) and Tral (Trailer Hitch) as components of a Zfrp8 protein complex. We show that Zfrp8 is required in the nucleus, and controls localization of FMRP in the cytoplasm. In addition, we demonstrate that Zfrp8 genetically interacts with Fmr1 and tral in an antagonistic manner. Zfrp8 and FMRP both control heterochromatin packaging, also in opposite ways. We propose that Zfrp8 functions as a chaperone, controlling protein complexes involved in RNA processing in the nucleus.           
26794591	Regional brain volumes changes in adult male FMR1-KO mouse on the FVB strain.         autism spectrum disorder, genetic mouse model, regional brain volumes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable single gene cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FMR1-KO mice mimic the etiology and phenotypic manifestations of FXS. Neuroanatomical changes in specific brain regions have been reported in clinical settings and in preclinical models. FMR1-KO mice have been generated in different strains including C57Bl/6 (B6) and FVB. Mice on different genetic backgrounds have stable yet distinct behavioral phenotypes that may lead to unique gene-strain interactions on brain structure. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have examined FMR1 knockout male mice on a B6 and found few differences compared to wild-type mice. Here, we examine brain volumes in FMR1 knockout male mice on a FVB background using high resolution (multi-channel 7.0Tesla) MRI. We observe multiple differences in the neuroanatomy of male FMR1-/y mice on a FVB background. Significantly larger relative volume (% total brain volume) differences were found in major white matter structures throughout the brain. In addition, there were changes in areas associated with fronto-striatal circuitry and other regions. Functional and structural connectivity differences are often seen in human ASD, and therefore, this increased white matter seen in the FMR1-KO-FVB could be highlighting a structural over-connectivity, which could lead to some of the behavioral abnormalities seen with the FMR1-KO-FVB mice. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of genetic strain contribution to brain structure.           
9254854	Molecular genetic analysis of the FMR-1 gene in a large collection of autistic patients.          A genetic etiology in autism is now strongly supported by family and twin studies. A 3:1 ratio of affected males to females suggests the involvement of at least one X-linked locus in the disease. Several reports have indicated an association of the fragile X chromosomal anomaly at Xq27.3 (FRAXA) with autism, whereas others have not supported this finding. We have so far collected blood from 105 simplex and 18 multiplex families and have assessed 141 patients by using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale, and psychometric tests. All four ADI-R algorithm criteria were met by 131 patients (93%), whereas 10 patients (7%) showed a broader phenotype of autism. Southern blot analysis was performed with three different enzymes, and filters were hybridized to an FMR-1-specific probe to detect amplification of the CCG repeat at FRAXA, to the complete FMR-1 cDNA probe, and to additional probes from the neighborhood of the gene. No significant changes were found in 139 patients (99%) from 122 families, other than the normal variations in the population. In the case of one multiplex family with three children showing no dysmorphic features of the fragile X syndrome (one male meeting 3 out of 4 ADI-algorithm criteria, one normal male with slight learning disability but negative ADI-R testing, and one fully autistic female), the FRAXA full-mutation-specific CCG-repeat expansion in the genotype was not correlated with the autism phenotype. Further analysis revealed a mosaic pattern of methylation at the FMR-1 gene locus in the two sons of the family, indicating at least a partly functional gene. Therefore, we conclude that the association of autism with fragile X at Xq27.3 is non-existent and exclude this location as a candidate gene region for autism.        
14755444	Association and transmission analysis of the FMR1 IVS10 + 14C-T variant in autism.          Evidence from the high male to female ratio of individuals with autism as well as suggestive linkage data have implicated the possible involvement of X chromosomal loci in the aetiology of autism. Studies of the FMR1 gene on Xq27 have shown that occasionally individuals, and particularly females, with the [CGG] repeat expansion and methylation mutation may present with autistic symptoms. However, molecular studies suggest that such mutations are not a major cause of autism. Previously, we have screened autism probands for mutations in regions of the FMR1 gene downstream of the [CGG] repeat and identified an intronic variant in the FMR1 gene, IVS10 + 14C-T, which was present at a significantly higher frequency in autistic individuals compared to controls individuals. We have now investigated this variant in a further 136 autism families and 186 control individuals. We have established that the variant is significantly more frequent among East Asian individuals within our affected and control groups (P < 0.0001) and although we observed a trend of higher transmission frequency of the rare allele to affected individuals, there was no significant evidence in either family-based or case/control association studies for this variant in autism (P > 0.05).          
28173181	The FMR1 promoter is selectively hydroxymethylated in primary neurons of fragile X syndrome patients.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a repeat expansion mutation near the FMR1 gene promoter and is the most common form of heritable intellectual disability and autism. Full mutations larger than 200 CGG repeats trigger FMR1 heterochromatinization and loss of gene expression, which is primarily responsible for the pathological features of FXS . In contrast, smaller pre-mutations of 55–200 CGG are associated with FMR1 overexpression and Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative condition. While the role of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in FMR1 gene silencing has been studied extensively, the role of 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC), a newly discovered epigenetic mark produced through active DNA demethylation, has not been previously investigated in FXS neurons. Here, we used two complementary epigenetic assays, 5hmC sensitive restriction digest and ten-eleven translocation-assisted bisulfite pyrosequencing, to quantify FMR1 5mC and 5hmC levels. We observed increased levels of 5hmC at the FMR1 promoter in FXS patient brains with full-mutations relative to pre-mutation carriers and unaffected controls. In addition, we found that 5hmC enrichment at the FMR1 locus in FXS cells is specific to neurons by utilizing a nuclei sorting technique to separate neuronal and glial DNA fractions from post-mortem brain tissues. This FMR1 5hmC enrichment was not present in cellular models of FXS including fibroblasts, lymphocytes and reprogrammed neurons, indicating they do not fully recapitulate this epigenetic feature of disease. Future studies could investigate the potential to leverage this epigenetic pathway to restore FMR1 expression and discern whether levels of 5hmC correlate with phenotypic severity.        
28183735	New insights into the regulatory function of CYFIP1 in the context of WAVE- and FMRP-containing complexes.         Autism, BP1-BP2 deletion, CYFIP1, Fragile X, Intellectual disability Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 1 (          CYFIP1) is a candidate gene for intellectual disability (ID), autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy. It is a member of a family of proteins that is highly conserved during evolution, sharing high homology with its Drosophila homolog, dCYFIP. CYFIP1 interacts with the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, encoded by the FMR1 gene), whose absence causes Fragile X syndrome, and with the translation initiation factor eIF4E. It is a member of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), thus representing a link between translational regulation and the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we present data showing a correlation between mRNA levels of CYFIP1 and other members of the WRC. This suggests a tight regulation of the levels of the WRC members, not only by post-translational mechanisms, as previously hypothesized. Moreover, we studied the impact of loss of function of both CYFIP1 and FMRP on neuronal growth and differentiation in two animal models - fly and mouse. We show that these two proteins antagonize each other's function not only during neuromuscular junction growth in the fly but also during new neuronal differentiation in the olfactory bulb of adult mice. Mechanistically, FMRP and CYFIP1 modulate mTor signaling in an antagonistic manner, likely via independent pathways, supporting the results obtained in mouse as well as in fly at the morphological level. Collectively, our results illustrate a new model to explain the cellular roles of FMRP and CYFIP1 and the molecular significance of their interaction.
25602250	Treatment of the psychiatric problems associated with fragile X syndrome.          This work reviews recent research regarding treatment of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The phenotype includes anxiety linked to sensory hyperarousal, hyperactivity, and attentional problems consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and social deficits leading to autism spectrum disorder in 60% of boys and 25% of girls with FXS.          
25606363	"Fragile X spectrum disorders.         Fragile X syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, intellectual disability, premutation The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), which codes for the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP), is located at Xp27.3. The normal allele of the FMR1 gene typically has 5 to 40 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region; abnormal alleles of dynamic mutations include the full mutation (> 200 CGG repeats), premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) and the gray zone mutation (45-54 CGG repeats). Premutation carriers are common in the general population with approximately 1 in 130-250 females and 1 in 250-810 males, whereas the full mutation and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) occur in approximately 1 in 4000 to 1 in 7000. FMR1 mutations account for a variety of phenotypes including the most common monogenetic cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism (FXS), the most common genetic form of ovarian failure, the fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI, premutation); and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS, premutation). The premutation can also cause developmental problems including ASD and ADHD especially in boys and psychopathology including anxiety and depression in children and adults. Some premutation carriers can have a deficit of FMRP and some unmethylated full mutation individuals can have elevated FMR1 mRNA that is considered a premutation problem. Therefore the term ""Fragile X Spectrum Disorder"" (FXSD) should be used to include the wide range of overlapping phenotypes observed in affected individuals with FMR1 mutations. In this review we focus on the phenotypes and genotypes of children with FXSD.         "
25606362	Modeling fragile X syndrome in the Fmr1 knockout mouse.         Fmr1 knockout mouse, Fragile X Syndrome, anxiety, attention, behavior, cognition, phenotyping, social behaviors Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a commonly inherited form of intellectual disability and one of the leading genetic causes for autism spectrum disorder. Clinical symptoms of FXS can include impaired cognition, anxiety, hyperactivity, social phobia, and repetitive behaviors. FXS is caused by a CGG repeat mutation which expands a region on the X chromosome containing the FMR1 gene. In FXS, a full mutation (> 200 repeats) leads to hypermethylation of FMR1, an epigenetic mechanism that effectively silences FMR1 gene expression and reduces levels of the FMR1 gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that is important for the regulation of protein expression. In an effort to further understand how loss of FMR1 and FMRP contribute to FXS symptomology, several FXS animal models have been created. The most well characterized rodent model is the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse, which lacks FMRP protein due to a disruption in its Fmr1 gene. Here, we review the behavioral phenotyping of the Fmr1 KO mouse to date, and discuss the clinical relevance of this mouse model to the human FXS condition. While much remains to be learned about FXS, the Fmr1 KO mouse is a valuable tool for understanding the repercussions of functional loss of FMRP and assessing the efficacy of pharmacological compounds in ameliorating the molecular and behavioral phenotypes relevant to FXS.         
11180223	FMR1 gene and fragile X syndrome.          Taxonomic features of fragile X syndrome (FXS) associated with the fragile X mutation have evolved over several decades. Males are more severely impacted cognitively than females, but both show declines in IQ scores as they age. Although many males with FXS exhibit autistic-like features, autism does not occur more frequently in males with FXS than among males with mental retardation (MR). FXS is caused by inactivation of the FMR1 gene located on Xq27.3. FMRP, the protein produced by FMR1, has been detected in most organs and in brain. In cells, it is located primarily in cytoplasm and contains motifs found in RNA-binding proteins. The FMRP N-terminal contains a functional nuclear localization signal which permits the protein to shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus. FMR1 knockout mice show subtle behavioral and visual-spatial difficulties. Analysis of their brain tissue suggests absence of FMRP impairs synaptic maturation. Individuals with the fragile premutation produce FMRP, and the phenotype associated with the premutation has been controversial. However, there seems to be a higher incidence of premature ovarian failure in women with the premutation than is found in the general female population. This may be related to unusual increases in mRNA levels in premutation carriers.        
24701200	2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP) reverses maze learning and PSD-95 deficits in Fmr1 knock-out mice.         2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine, Hebb-Williams mazes, Western blot, fragile X syndrome, post-synaptic density-95 Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is caused by the lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which results in intellectual disability and other debilitating symptoms including impairment of visual-spatial functioning. FXS is the only single-gene disorder that is highly co-morbid with autism spectrum disorder and can therefore provide insight into its pathophysiology. Lack of FMRP results in altered group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling, which is a target for putative treatments. The Hebb-Williams (H-W) mazes are a set of increasingly complex spatial navigation problems that depend on intact hippocampal and thus mGluR-5 functioning. In the present investigation, we examined whether an antagonist of mGluR-5 would reverse previously described behavioral deficits in fragile X mental retardation 1 knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice. Mice were trained on a subset of the H-W mazes and then treated with either 20 mg/kg of an mGluR-5 antagonist, 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP; n = 11) or an equivalent dose of saline (n = 11) prior to running test mazes. Latency and errors were dependent variables recorded during the test phase. Immediately after completing each test, marble-burying behavior was assessed, which confirmed that the drug treatment was pharmacologically active during maze learning. Although latency was not statistically different between the groups, MPEP treated Fmr1 KO mice made significantly fewer errors on mazes deemed more difficult suggesting a reversal of the behavioral deficit. MPEP treated mice were also less perseverative and impulsive when navigating mazes. Furthermore, MPEP treatment reversed post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) protein deficits in Fmr1 KO treated mice, whereas levels of a control protein (β-tubulin) remained unchanged. These data further validate MPEP as a potentially beneficial treatment for FXS. Our findings also suggest that adapted H-W mazes may be a useful tool to document alterations in behavioral functioning following pharmacological intervention in FXS.         
24713347	Degraded speech sound processing in a rat model of fragile X syndrome.         Auditory cortex, Fragile X syndrome, Speech Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading genetic cause of autism. Impaired phonological processing in fragile X syndrome interferes with the development of language skills. Although auditory cortex responses are known to be abnormal in fragile X syndrome, it is not clear how these differences impact speech sound processing. This study provides the first evidence that the cortical representation of speech sounds is impaired in Fmr1 knockout rats, despite normal speech discrimination behavior. Evoked potentials and spiking activity in response to speech sounds, noise burst trains, and tones were significantly degraded in primary auditory cortex, anterior auditory field and the ventral auditory field. Neurometric analysis of speech evoked activity using a pattern classifier confirmed that activity in these fields contains significantly less information about speech sound identity in Fmr1 knockout rats compared to control rats. Responses were normal in the posterior auditory field, which is associated with sound localization. The greatest impairment was observed in the ventral auditory field, which is related to emotional regulation. Dysfunction in the ventral auditory field may contribute to poor emotional regulation in fragile X syndrome and may help explain the observation that later auditory evoked responses are more disturbed in fragile X syndrome compared to earlier responses. Rodent models of fragile X syndrome are likely to prove useful for understanding the biological basis of fragile X syndrome and for testing candidate therapies.           
24715853	Microdeletions including FMR1 in three female patients with intellectual disability - further delineation of the phenotype and expression studies.         Expression, FMR1, Intellectual disability, Microdeletion, Xq27.3–q28 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common causes of intellectual disability/developmental delay (ID/DD), especially in males. It is caused most often by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions, and less frequently by point mutations and partial or full deletions of the FMR1 gene. The wide clinical spectrum of affected females partly depends on their X-inactivation status. Only few female ID/DD patients with microdeletions including FMR1 have been reported. We describe 3 female patients with 3.5-, 4.2- and 9.2-Mb de novo microdeletions in Xq27.3-q28 containing FMR1. X-inactivation was random in all patients, yet they presented with ID/DD as well as speech delay, macrocephaly and other features attributable to FXS. No signs of autism were present. Here, we further delineate the clinical spectrum of female patients with microdeletions. FMR1 expression studies gave no evidence for an absolute threshold below which signs of FXS present. Since FMR1 expression is known to be highly variable between unrelated females, and since FMR1 mRNA levels have been suggested to be more similar among family members, we further explored the possibility of an intrafamilial effect. Interestingly, FMR1 mRNA levels in all 3 patients were significantly lower than in their respective mothers, which was shown to be specific for patients with microdeletions containing FMR1.         
24963073	Mutational analyses of the FMR1 gene in Chinese pediatric population of fragile x suspects: low tolerance for point mutation.          FMR1 mutation, Chinese pediatrics, deletion CGG repeat expansion is the most common cause of fragile X syndrome. Numerous efforts have been made to identify novel mutations in patients with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and/or autism. To evaluate the mutational spectrum in the at-risk Chinese population, 60 pediatric patients presenting fragile X traits but normal-sized CGG repeats were sequenced for all 17 exons and regulatory regions in FMR1. A c.879A>C mutation, reported to alter a neighboring splicing, was detected in a severely retarded male and his normal mother. However, the exon junction appears unaffected. A 237-kb deletion covering the entire FMR1 was identified to cause moderate intellectual disability and marked hyperactivity in an 8-year-old boy. The 5' and 3' breakpoints were buried in the surrounding long interspersed and short interspersed elements, respectively. In general, missense mutations do not commonly cause fragile X syndrome, whereas deletions should be considered with caution in patient referrals presenting with developmental delay and/or ordinary retardation.           
19166269	"A novel function for fragile X mental retardation protein in translational activation.          Fragile X syndrome, the most frequent form of inherited mental retardation, is due to the absence of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in several steps of RNA metabolism. To date, two RNA motifs have been found to mediate FMRP/RNA interaction, the G-quartet and the ""kissing complex,"" which both induce translational repression in the presence of FMRP. We show here a new role for FMRP as a positive modulator of translation. FMRP specifically binds Superoxide Dismutase 1 (Sod1) mRNA with high affinity through a novel RNA motif, SoSLIP (Sod1 mRNA Stem Loops Interacting with FMRP), which is folded as three independent stem-loop structures. FMRP induces a structural modification of the SoSLIP motif upon its interaction with it. SoSLIP also behaves as a translational activator whose action is potentiated by the interaction with FMRP. The absence of FMRP results in decreased expression of Sod1. Because it has been observed that brain metabolism of FMR1 null mice is more sensitive to oxidative stress, we propose that the deregulation of Sod1 expression may be at the basis of several traits of the physiopathology of the Fragile X syndrome, such as anxiety, sleep troubles, and autism.        "
19085879	[ARX mutations and mental retardation of unknown etiology: three new cases in Spain].          Mental retardation has an approximated prevalence of 2% in the general population and its most frequent cause is X-fragile syndrome. This genetic disorder predominantly affects males and it is mainly caused by the expansion of CGG in FMR1 gene. Recently has been demonstrated that mutations in a new called ARX gene (aristaless-related homeobox) can also cause a similar form of X linked mental retardation, as well as other neurological disorders (autism, Partington or West syndrome). The most frequent mutation that has been reported is the c.428_451 dup24, which comprises almost 60% of all described. It causes an expansion of a polyalanine tract of ARX protein.          
24211451	Temporal and spectral differences in the ultrasonic vocalizations of fragile X knock out mice during postnatal development.         Autism spectrum disorders, Fragile X, Postnatal development, Spectral analysis, Ultrasonic vocalizations The fmr1 knock out (KO) mouse has been a useful animal model to understand pathology and treatment of FXS, both anatomically and behaviorally. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a behavioral tool to assess early life communication deficits in mice. Here, we report on the temporal and spectral features of USVs emitted after maternal separation in wild type (FVB/N) and fmr1 KO pups at postnatal days (P) P4, P7 and P10. The results show changes in the number and duration of calls in fmr1 KO pups and wild type pups were dependent on age and call type. Fmr1 KO pups showed an increased number of USVs at P7 but not at P4 or P10. This increase was specific to Frequency Jump calls. In addition, fmr1 KO mice showed a developmental shift in the temporal distribution of calls, with P10 mice calling in distinct bout patterns. Overall, these findings provide evidence that changes in USV outcomes were specific to certain call types and ages in fmr1 KO mice. Because early postnatal life is a window during which multiple neural systems activate and become established, behavioral measures such as using USVs as a measure of communication, may be useful as a predictor of brain changes and later developmental behavioral changes. Work is needed to better understand the functional outcomes of altered development of USVs and how these changes contribute to later emergence of autistic-like behaviors in animal models of autism.           
24232444	Fragile X syndrome: a preclinical review on metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonists and drug development.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is considered the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. In FXS, the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene is silenced and the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is not expressed, resulting in the characteristic features of the syndrome. Despite recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of FXS, there is still no cure for this condition; current treatment is symptomatic. Preclinical research is essential in the development of potential therapeutic agents.          
21856714	Hyperconnectivity and slow synapses during early development of medial prefrontal cortex in a mouse model for mental retardation and autism.          Neuronal theories of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) of autism and mental retardation propose that abnormal connectivity underlies deficits in attentional processing. We tested this theory by studying unitary synaptic connections between layer 5 pyramidal neurons within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) networks in the Fmr1-KO mouse model for mental retardation and autism. In line with predictions from neurocognitive theory, we found that neighboring pyramidal neurons were hyperconnected during a critical period in early mPFC development. Surprisingly, excitatory synaptic connections between Fmr1-KO pyramidal neurons were significantly slower and failed to recover from short-term depression as quickly as wild type (WT) synapses. By 4-5 weeks of mPFC development, connectivity rates were identical for both KO and WT pyramidal neurons and synapse dynamics changed from depressing to facilitating responses with similar properties in both groups. We propose that the early alteration in connectivity and synaptic recovery are tightly linked: using a network model, we show that slower synapses are essential to counterbalance hyperconnectivity in order to maintain a dynamic range of excitatory activity. However, the slow synaptic time constants induce decreased responsiveness to low-frequency stimulation, which may explain deficits in integration and early information processing in attentional neuronal networks in NDDs.        
21867686	Folic acid supplementation dysregulates gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells--implications in nutrition.          For over a decade, folic acid (FA) supplementation has been widely prescribed to pregnant women to prevent neural tube closure defects in newborns. Although neural tube closure occurs within the first trimester, high doses of FA are given throughout pregnancy, the physiological consequences of which are unknown. FA can cause epigenetic modification of the cytosine residues in the CpG dinucleotide, thereby affecting gene expression. Dysregulation of crucial gene expression during gestational development may have lifelong adverse effects or lead to neurodevelopmental defects, such as autism. We have investigated the effect of FA supplementation on gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells by whole-genome expression microarrays. The results showed that high FA caused dysregulation by ≥ four-fold up or down to more than 1000 genes, including many imprinted genes. The aberrant expression of three genes (FMR1, GPR37L1, TSSK3) was confirmed by Western blot analyses. The level of altered gene expression changed in an FA concentration-dependent manner. We found significant dysregulation in gene expression at concentrations as low as 15 ng/ml, a level that is lower than what has been achieved in the blood through FA fortification guidelines. We found evidence of aberrant promoter methylation in the CpG island of the TSSK3 gene. Excessive FA supplementation may require careful monitoring in women who are planning for, or are in the early stages of pregnancy. Aberrant expression of genes during early brain development may have an impact on behavioural characteristics.          
22348382	Optimizing the phenotyping of rodent ASD models: enrichment analysis of mouse and human neurobiological phenotypes associated with high-risk autism genes identifies morphological, electrophysiological, neurological, and behavioral features.          There is interest in defining mouse neurobiological phenotypes useful for studying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in both forward and reverse genetic approaches. A recurrent focus has been on high-order behavioral analyses, including learning and memory paradigms and social paradigms. However, well-studied mouse models, including for example Fmr1 knockout mice, do not show dramatic deficits in such high-order phenotypes, raising a question as to what constitutes useful phenotypes in ASD models.          
27656021	Dysregulated NMDA-Receptor Signaling Inhibits Long-Term Depression in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.         GluN2B, NMDA receptor antagonists, autism, fragile X, long-term depression, mGluR Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disease. It is one of the leading monogenic causes of intellectual disability among boys with most also displaying autism spectrum disorder traits. Here we investigated the role of NMDA receptors on mGluR-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD), a key biomarker in the disease, at four different developmental stages. First, we applied the mGluR agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine in the absence or presence of the NMDAR blocker, APV, hereby unmasking the NMDAR component in this process. As expected, in the presence of APV, we found more LTD in the mouse KO than in WT. This, however, was only observed in the p30-60 age group. At all other age groups tested, mGluR-LTD was almost identical between KO and WT. Interestingly, at p60, in the absence of APV, no or very little LTD was found in KO that was completely restored by application of APV. This suggests that the underlying cause of the enhanced mGluR-LTD in KO (at p30) is caused by dysregulated NMDAR signaling. To investigate this further, we next used NMDAR-subunit-specific antagonists. Inhibition of GluN2B, but not GluN2A, blocked mGluR-LTD only in WT. This was in contrast in the KO where blocking GluN2B rescued mGluR-LTD, suggesting GluN2B-containing NMDARs in the KO are hyperactive. Thus, these findings suggest strong involvement of GluN2B-containing-NMDARs in the pathophysiology of FXS and highlight a potential path for treatment for the disease.          
27663742	"Elevated ERK/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase activity underlies audiogenic seizure susceptibility in fragile X mice.         FMRP, RSK, autism, intellectual disability, mTOR Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and a leading genetic form of autism. The Fmr1 KO mouse, a model of FXS, exhibits elevated translation in the hippocampus and the cortex. ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling regulate protein synthesis by activating downstream targets critical to translation initiation and elongation and are known to contribute to hippocampal defects in fragile X. Here we show that the effect of loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) on these pathways is brain region specific. In contrast to the hippocampus, ERK (but not mTOR) signaling is elevated in the neocortex of fragile X mice. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, typically a downstream target of mTOR, is elevated in the neocortex, despite normal mTOR activity. This is significant in that S6 phosphorylation facilitates translation, correlates with neuronal activation, and is altered in neurodevelopmental disorders. We show that in fragile X mice, S6 is regulated by ERK via the ""alternative"" S6 kinase p90-ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), as evidenced by the site of elevated phosphorylation and the finding that ERK inhibition corrects elevated RSK and S6 activity. These findings indicate that signaling networks are altered in the neocortex of fragile X mice such that S6 phosphorylation receives aberrant input from ERK/RSK. Importantly, an RSK inhibitor reduces susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in fragile X mice. Our findings identify RSK as a therapeutic target for fragile X and suggest the therapeutic potential of drugs for the treatment of FXS may vary in a brain-region-specific manner.        "
27664080	Depletion of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein in Embryonic Stem Cells Alters the Kinetics of Neurogenesis.         Autism, Embryonic stem cells, Fragile X syndrome, Intellectual disability, Neurogenesis, Therapeutic window Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and a leading cause of autism. FXS is due to the silencing of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein mainly involved in translational control, dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. Despite extensive studies, there is currently no cure for FXS. With the purpose to decipher the initial molecular events leading to this pathology, we developed a stem-cell-based disease model by knocking-down the expression of Fmr1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Repressing FMRP in ESCs increased the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Ascl1. When inducing neuronal differentiation, βIII-tubulin, p27          kip1 , NeuN, and NeuroD1 were upregulated, leading to an accelerated neuronal differentiation that was partially compensated at later stages. Interestingly, we observed that neurogenesis is also accelerated in the embryonic brain of Fmr1-knockout mice, indicating that our cellular model recapitulates the molecular alterations present in vivo. Importantly, we rescued the main phenotype of the Fmr1 knockdown cell line, not only by reintroducing FMRP but also by pharmacologically targeting APP processing, showing the role of this protein in the pathophysiology of FXS during the earliest steps of neurogenesis. Our work allows to define an early therapeutic window but also to identify more effective molecules for treating this disorder. Stem Cells 2017;35:374-385.
27672537	Fragile X syndrome: A review of clinical management.         Autism Spectrum Disorder, FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, Intellectual Disability, clinical guidelines, clinical management, developmental delay, medical problems, premutation, treatment The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene, which codes for the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein, usually has 5 to 40 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated promoter. The full mutation is the almost always the cause of fragile X syndrome (FXS). The prevalence of FXS is about 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 7,000 in the general population although the prevalence varies in different regions of the world. FXS is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. The understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has led to many targeted treatments, but none have cured this disorder. The treatment of the medical problems and associated behaviors remain the most useful intervention for children with FXS. In this review, we focus on the non-pharmacological and pharmacological management of medical and behavioral problems associated with FXS as well as current recommendations for follow-up and surveillance.         
27260404	ELAVL2-regulated transcriptional and splicing networks in human neurons link neurodevelopment and autism.          The role of post-transcriptional gene regulation in human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders remains mostly uncharacterized. ELAV-like RNA-binding proteins (RNAbps) are a family of proteins that regulate several aspects of neuronal function including neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, both critical to the normal function of the brain in cognition and behavior. Here, we identify the downstream neuronal transcriptional and splicing networks of ELAVL2, an RNAbp with previously unknown function in the brain. Expression of ELAVL2 was reduced in human neurons and RNA-sequencing was utilized to identify networks of differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes resulting from haploinsufficient levels of ELAVL2. These networks contain a number of autism-relevant genes as well as previously identified targets of other important RNAbps implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including RBFOX1 and FMRP. ELAVL2-regulated co-expression networks are also enriched for neurodevelopmental and synaptic genes, and include genes with human-specific patterns of expression in the frontal pole. Together, these data suggest that ELAVL2 regulation of transcript expression is critical for neuronal function and clinically relevant to ASD.          
27273096	Augmented noncanonical BMP type II receptor signaling mediates the synaptic abnormality of fragile X syndrome.          Epigenetic silencing of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) causes fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism. FXS correlates with abnormal synapse and dendritic spine development, but the molecular link between the absence of the FMR1 product FMRP, an RNA binding protein, and the neuropathology is unclear. We found that the messenger RNA encoding bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2) is a target of FMRP. Depletion of FMRP increased BMPR2 abundance, especially that of the full-length isoform that bound and activated LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), a component of the noncanonical BMP signal transduction pathway that stimulates actin reorganization to promote neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Heterozygosity for BMPR2 rescued the morphological abnormalities in neurons both in Drosophila and in mouse models of FXS, as did the postnatal pharmacological inhibition of LIMK1 activity. Compared with postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue from healthy subjects, the amount of full-length BMPR2 and of a marker of LIMK1 activity was increased in this brain region from FXS patients. These findings suggest that increased BMPR2 signal transduction is linked to FXS and that the BMPR2-LIMK1 pathway is a putative therapeutic target in patients with FXS and possibly other forms of autism.          
23542787	Targeting the endocannabinoid system in the treatment of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism, is caused by the silencing of the FMR1 gene, leading to the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a synaptically expressed RNA-binding protein regulating translation. The Fmr1 knockout model recapitulates the main traits of the disease. Uncontrolled activity of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling seem crucial in the pathology of this disease. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity, cognitive performance, anxiety, nociception and seizure susceptibility, all of which are affected in FXS. The cannabinoid receptors CB1 (CB1R) and CB2 (CB2R) are activated by phospholipid-derived endocannabinoids, and CB1R-driven long-term regulation of synaptic strength, as a consequence of mGluR5 activation, is altered in several brain areas of Fmr1 knockout mice. We found that CB1R blockade in male Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1(-/y)) mice through pharmacological and genetic approaches normalized cognitive impairment, nociceptive desensitization, susceptibility to audiogenic seizures, overactivated mTOR signaling and altered spine morphology, whereas pharmacological blockade of CB2R normalized anxiolytic-like behavior. Some of these traits were also reversed by pharmacological inhibition of mTOR or mGluR5. Thus, blockade of ECS is a potential therapeutic approach to normalize specific alterations in FXS.        
23548045	A quantitative homogeneous assay for fragile X mental retardation 1 protein.          Hypermethylation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene FMR1 results in decreased expression of FMR1 protein FMRP, which is the underlying cause of Fragile X syndrome - an incurable neurological disorder characterized by mental retardation, anxiety, epileptic episodes and autism. Disease-modifying therapies for Fragile X syndrome are thus aimed at treatments that increase the FMRP expression levels in the brain. We describe the development and characterization of two assays for simple and quantitative detection of FMRP protein.          
23509247	Rescue of fragile X syndrome phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice by the small-molecule PAK inhibitor FRAX486.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of autism and intellectual disability and is caused by the silencing of a single gene, fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1). The Fmr1 KO mouse displays phenotypes similar to symptoms in the human condition--including hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and seizures--as well as analogous abnormalities in the density of dendritic spines. Here we take a hypothesis-driven, mechanism-based approach to the search for an effective therapy for FXS. We hypothesize that a treatment that rescues the dendritic spine defect in Fmr1 KO mice may also ameliorate autism-like behavioral symptoms. Thus, we targeted a protein that regulates spines through modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics: p21-activated kinase (PAK). Our results demonstrate that a potent small molecule inhibitor of group I PAKs reverses dendritic spine phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, this PAK inhibitor--which we call FRAX486--also rescues seizures and behavioral abnormalities such as hyperactivity and repetitive movements, thereby supporting the hypothesis that a drug treatment that reverses the spine abnormalities can also treat neurological and behavioral symptoms. Finally, a single administration of FRAX486 is sufficient to rescue all of these phenotypes in adult Fmr1 KO mice, demonstrating the potential for rapid, postdiagnostic therapy in adults with FXS.        
23523717	Language dysfluencies in females with the FMR1 premutation.          Recent evidence suggests that there are age-related neurocognitive implications for fragile X premutation carriers, including deficits in executive function, and that such deficits are more common in male than female premutation carriers. The purpose of the current study is to examine one aspect of executive function, language dysfluencies, in a group of 193 women with the premutation, and to contrast them with a comparison group (mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders). Our results demonstrate a linguistic profile in the female premutation carriers characterized by dysfluencies associated with deficits in organization and planning, with a clear impact of age. The comparison group, matched on both age and education level, did not demonstrate the age effect. Our results suggest dysfluencies could be an early indicator of cognitive aging in some female premutation carriers, and could be used to target early intervention.          
30097759	Vagal Tone as a Putative Mechanism for Pragmatic Competence: An Investigation of Carriers of the FMR1 Premutation.         Fragile X carrier, HRV, RSA, Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder, Social communication Pragmatic language skills exist across a continuum in typical and clinical populations, and are impaired in many neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably autism. The mechanisms underlying pragmatic impairment are poorly understood, although theory suggests dampened vagal tone plays a role. This study investigated the FMR1 premutation as a genetic model that may lend insight into the relationship between vagal function and pragmatic ability. Participants included 38 women with the FMR1 premutation and 23 controls. Vagal tone accounted for significant variance in pragmatics across both groups and statistically mediated the effect of FMR1 premutation status on pragmatic ability. Results support vagal tone as a biophysiological correlate of pragmatic ability, which informs potential mechanistic underpinnings and could have implications for targeted treatment.        
30115809	Fragile X mental retardation 1 gene enhances the translation of large autism-related proteins.          Mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (          FMR1) cause the most common inherited human autism spectrum disorder. FMR1 influences messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, but identifying functional targets has been difficult. We analyzed quiescent Drosophila oocytes, which, like neural synapses, depend heavily on translating stored mRNA. Ribosome profiling revealed that FMR1 enhances rather than represses the translation of mRNAs that overlap previously identified FMR1 targets, and acts preferentially on large proteins. Human homologs of at least 20 targets are associated with dominant intellectual disability, and 30 others with recessive neurodevelopmental dysfunction. Stored oocytes lacking FMR1 usually generate embryos with severe neural defects, unlike stored wild-type oocytes, which suggests that translation of multiple large proteins by stored mRNAs is defective in fragile X syndrome and possibly other autism spectrum disorders.
25079250	Rescue of fragile X syndrome phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice by a BKCa channel opener molecule.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and is also associated with autism spectrum disorders. Previous studies implicated BKCa channels in the neuropathogenesis of FXS, but the main question was whether pharmacological BKCa stimulation would be able to rescue FXS neurobehavioral phenotypes.          
25348604	Early social enrichment rescues adult behavioral and brain abnormalities in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Converging lines of evidence support the use of environmental stimulation to ameliorate the symptoms of a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Applying these interventions at very early ages is critical to achieve a marked reduction of the pathological phenotypes. Here we evaluated the impact of early social enrichment in Fmr1-KO mice, a genetic mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a major developmental disorder and the most frequent monogenic cause of autism. Enrichment was achieved by providing male KO pups and their WT littermates with enhanced social stimulation, housing them from birth until weaning with the mother and an additional nonlactating female. At adulthood they were tested for locomotor, social, and cognitive abilities; furthermore, dendritic alterations were assessed in the hippocampus and amygdala, two brain regions known to be involved in the control of the examined behaviors and affected by spine pathology in Fmr1-KOs. Enrichment rescued the behavioral FXS-like deficits displayed in adulthood by Fmr1-KO mice, that is, hyperactivity, reduced social interactions, and cognitive deficits. Early social enrichment also eliminated the abnormalities shown by adult KO mice in the morphology of hippocampal and amygdala dendritic spines, namely an enhanced density of immature vs mature types. Importantly, enrichment did not induce neurobehavioral changes in WT mice, thus supporting specific effects on FXS-like pathology. These findings show that early environmental stimulation has profound and long-term beneficial effects on the pathological FXS phenotype, thereby encouraging the use of nonpharmacological interventions for the treatment of this and perhaps other neurodevelopmental diseases.         
22067669	The GABA(A) receptor agonist THIP ameliorates specific behavioral deficits in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Hyperactivity, hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli, and exaggerated fear are common behavioral abnormalities observed in individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder that is the most common genetic cause of autism. Evidence from studies of the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS supports the notion that impaired GABAergic transmission in different brain regions such as the amygdala, striatum or cerebral cortex is central to FXS behavioral abnormalities. This suggests that the GABAergic system might be an intriguing target to ameliorate some of the phenotypes in FXS. Our recent work revealed that THIP (gaboxadol), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, can restore principal neuron excitability deficits in the Fmr1 KO amygdala, suggesting that THIP may also restore some of the key behavioral abnormalities in Fmr1 KO mice. Here, we reveal that THIP significantly attenuated hyperactivity in Fmr1 KO mice, and reduced prepulse inhibition in a volume-dependent manner. In contrast, THIP did not reverse the deficits in cued fear or startle response. Thus, this study shows that enhancing GABAergic transmission can correct specific behavioral phenotypes of the Fmr1 KO mouse further supporting that targeting the GABAergic system, and specifically tonic inhibition, might be important for correcting or ameliorating some key behaviors in FXS.          
22080836	In vivo neuronal function of the fragile X mental retardation protein is regulated by phosphorylation.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene product (FMRP), is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. It has been long hypothesized that the phosphorylation of serine 500 (S500) in human FMRP controls its function as an RNA-binding translational repressor. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we employed neuronally targeted expression of three human FMR1 transgenes, including wild-type (hFMR1), dephosphomimetic (S500A-hFMR1) and phosphomimetic (S500D-hFMR1), in the Drosophila FXS disease model to investigate phosphorylation requirements. At the molecular level, dfmr1 null mutants exhibit elevated brain protein levels due to loss of translational repressor activity. This defect is rescued for an individual target protein and across the population of brain proteins by the phosphomimetic, whereas the dephosphomimetic phenocopies the null condition. At the cellular level, dfmr1 null synapse architecture exhibits increased area, branching and bouton number. The phosphomimetic fully rescues these synaptogenesis defects, whereas the dephosphomimetic provides no rescue. The presence of Futsch-positive (microtubule-associated protein 1B) supernumerary microtubule loops is elevated in dfmr1 null synapses. The human phosphomimetic restores normal Futsch loops, whereas the dephosphomimetic provides no activity. At the behavioral level, dfmr1 null mutants exhibit strongly impaired olfactory associative learning. The human phosphomimetic targeted only to the brain-learning center restores normal learning ability, whereas the dephosphomimetic provides absolutely no rescue. We conclude that human FMRP S500 phosphorylation is necessary for its in vivo function as a neuronal translational repressor and regulator of synaptic architecture, and for the manifestation of FMRP-dependent learning behavior.        
22087250	Elevated levels of the vesicular monoamine transporter and a novel repetitive behavior in the Drosophila model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is characterized by mental impairment and autism in humans, and it often features hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors. The mechanisms for the disease, however, remain poorly understood. Here we report that the dfmr1 mutant in the Drosophila model of FXS grooms excessively, which may be regulated differentially by two signaling pathways. Blocking metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling enhances grooming in dfmr1 mutant flies, whereas blocking the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) suppresses excessive grooming. dfmr1 mutant flies also exhibit elevated levels of VMAT mRNA and protein. These results suggest that enhanced monoamine signaling correlates with repetitive behaviors and hyperactivity associated with FXS.        
17435464	The Prader-Willi phenotype of fragile X syndrome.          The Prader-Willi phenotype (PWP) of fragile X syndrome (FXS) is associated with obesity and hyperphagia similar to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), but without cytogenetic or methylation abnormalities at 15q11-13. Thirteen cases of PWP and FXS are reported here that were identified by obesity and hyperphagia. Delayed puberty was seen in 5 of 9 cases who had entered puberty, a small penis or testicles in seven of 13 cases, and infant hypotonia and/or a poor suck in seven of 13 cases. Autism spectrum disorder occurred in 10 of 13 cases, and autism was diagnosed in seven of 13 cases. We investigated cytoplasmic interacting FMR1 protein (CYFIP) expression, which is a protein that interacts with FMR1 protein (FMRP) because the gene for CYFIP is located at 15q11-13. CYFIP mRNA levels were significantly reduced in our patients with the PWP and FXS compared to individuals without FXS (p < .001) and also individuals with FXS without PWP (p = .03).        
28923933	Longitudinal identification of clinically distinct neurophenotypes in young children with fragile X syndrome.         MRI, autism spectrum behavior, fragile X syndrome, longitudinal development, multivariate pattern classification Fragile X syndrome (FXS), due to mutations of the         FMR1 gene, is the most common known inherited cause of developmental disability. The cognitive, behavioral, and neurological phenotypes observed in affected individuals can vary considerably, making it difficult to predict outcomes and determine the need for interventions. We sought to examine early structural brain growth as a potential marker for identification of clinically meaningful subgroups. Participants included 42 very young boys with FXS who completed a T1-weighted anatomical MRI and cognitive/behavioral assessment at two longitudinal time points, with mean ages of 2.89 y and 4.91 y. Topological data analysis (TDA), an unsupervised approach to multivariate pattern analysis, was applied to the longitudinal anatomical data to identify coherent but heretofore unknown subgroups. TDA revealed two large subgroups within the study population based solely on longitudinal MRI data. Post hoc comparisons of cognition, adaptive functioning, and autism severity scores between these groups demonstrated that one group was consistently higher functioning on all measures at both time points, with pronounced and significant unidirectional differences (P < 0.05 for time point 1 and/or time point 2 for each measure). These results support the existence of two longitudinally defined, neuroanatomically distinct, and clinically relevant phenotypes among boys with FXS. If confirmed by additional analyses, such information may be used to predict outcomes and guide design of targeted therapies. Furthermore, TDA of longitudinal anatomical MRI data may represent a useful method for reliably and objectively defining subtypes within other neuropsychiatric disorders.
28929824	Size and methylation mosaicism in males with Fragile X syndrome.         FMR1mRNA, FMRP, deletion, fragile X syndrome, methylation, mosaicism, transcription Size and methylation mosaicism are a common phenomenon in Fragile X syndrome (FXS). Here, the authors report a study on twelve fragile X males with atypical mosaicism, seven of whom presented with autism spectrum disorder.          
29590342	Protein synthesis levels are increased in a subset of individuals with fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic form of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). In biological models for the disease, this leads to upregulated mRNA translation and as a consequence, deficits in synaptic architecture and plasticity. Preclinical studies revealed that pharmacological interventions restore those deficits, which are thought to mediate the FXS cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Here, we characterized the de novo rate of protein synthesis in patients with FXS and their relationship with clinical severity. We measured the rate of protein synthesis in fibroblasts derived from 32 individuals with FXS and from 17 controls as well as in fibroblasts and primary neurons of 27 Fmr1 KO mice and 20 controls. Here, we show that levels of protein synthesis are increased in fibroblasts of individuals with FXS and Fmr1 KO mice. However, this cellular phenotype displays a broad distribution and a proportion of fragile X individuals and Fmr1 KO mice do not show increased levels of protein synthesis, having measures in the normal range. Because the same Fmr1 KO animal measures in fibroblasts predict those in neurons we suggest the validity of this peripheral biomarker. Our study offers a potential explanation for the comprehensive drug development program undertaken thus far yielding negative results and suggests that a significant proportion, but not all individuals with FXS, may benefit from the reduction of excessive levels of protein synthesis.        
29599705	Of Men and Mice: Modeling the Fragile X Syndrome.         E/I balance, FMR1, Fragile X Syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, behavior and cognition, microsatellite instability, mouse model, primates The Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common forms of inherited intellectual disability in all human societies. Caused by the transcriptional silencing of a single gene, the fragile x mental retardation gene         FMR1, FXS is characterized by a variety of symptoms, which range from mental disabilities to autism and epilepsy. More than 20 years ago, a first animal model was described, the Fmr1 knock-out mouse. Several other models have been developed since then, including conditional knock-out mice, knock-out rats, a zebrafish and a drosophila model. Using these model systems, various targets for potential pharmaceutical treatments have been identified and many treatments have been shown to be efficient in preclinical studies. However, all attempts to turn these findings into a therapy for patients have failed thus far. In this review, I will discuss underlying difficulties and address potential alternatives for our future research.
16555225	[Autism in fragile X syndrome].          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of hereditary mental retardation, as well as being a common cause of learning disorders and psychiatric problems. It is characterised by very specific physical and behavioural phenotypes. For this reason FXS is an excellent model of the relation between behaviour and genes. FXS is also the commonest cause of autism identified to date. Between 2 and 6% of children with autism have FXS, and approximately 3% of children with FXS have autism.          
24904293	Distinctive behavioral and cellular responses to fluoxetine in the mouse model for Fragile X syndrome.         BDNF, TrkB receptors, autism, behavior, neurogenesis Fluoxetine is used as a therapeutic agent for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including Fragile X syndrome (FXS). The treatment often associates with disruptive behaviors such as agitation and disinhibited behaviors in FXS. To identify mechanisms that increase the risk to poor treatment outcome, we investigated the behavioral and cellular effects of fluoxetine on adult Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model for FXS. We found that fluoxetine reduced anxiety-like behavior of both wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice seen as shortened latency to enter the center area in the open field test. In Fmr1 KO mice, fluoxetine normalized locomotor hyperactivity but abnormally increased exploratory activity. Reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and increased TrkB receptor expression levels in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice associated with inappropriate coping responses under stressful condition and abolished antidepressant activity of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine response in the cell proliferation was also missing in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice when compared with wild-type controls. The postnatal mRNA expression of serotonin transporter (SERT) was reduced in the thalamic nuclei of Fmr1 KO mice during the time of transient innervation of somatosensory neurons suggesting that developmental changes of SERT expression were involved in the differential cellular and behavioral responses to fluoxetine in wild-type and Fmr1 mice. The results indicate that changes of BDNF/TrkB signaling contribute to differential behavioral responses to fluoxetine among individuals with ASD.         
24906019	"Transcriptional consequences of 16p11.2 deletion and duplication in mouse cortex and multiplex autism families.          Reciprocal copy-number variation (CNV) of a 593 kb region of 16p11.2 is a common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet it is not completely penetrant and can manifest in a wide array of phenotypes. To explore its molecular consequences, we performed RNA sequencing of cerebral cortex from mouse models with CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region and lymphoblast lines from 34 members of 7 multiplex ASD-affected families harboring the 16p11.2 CNV. Expression of all genes in the CNV region correlated well with their DNA copy number, with no evidence of dosage compensation. We observed effects on gene expression outside the CNV region, including apparent positional effects in cis and in trans at genomic segments with evidence of physical interaction in Hi-C chromosome conformation data. One of the most significant positional effects was telomeric to the 16p11.2 CNV and includes the previously described ""distal"" 16p11.2 microdeletion. Overall, 16p11.2 CNV was associated with altered expression of genes and networks that converge on multiple hypotheses of ASD pathogenesis, including synaptic function (e.g., NRXN1, NRXN3), chromatin modification (e.g., CHD8, EHMT1, MECP2), transcriptional regulation (e.g., TCF4, SATB2), and intellectual disability (e.g., FMR1, CEP290). However, there were differences between tissues and species, with the strongest effects being consistently within the CNV region itself. Our analyses suggest that through a combination of indirect regulatory effects and direct effects on nuclear architecture, alteration of 16p11.2 genes disrupts expression networks that involve other genes and pathways known to contribute to ASD, suggesting an overlap in mechanisms of pathogenesis.           "
18398441	Fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome, an X-linked dominant disorder with reduced penetrance, is associated with intellectual and emotional disabilities ranging from learning problems to mental retardation, and mood instability to autism. It is most often caused by the transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene, due to an expansion of a CGG repeat found in the 5'-untranslated region. The FMR1 gene product, FMRP, is a selective RNA-binding protein that negatively regulates local protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites. In its absence, the transcripts normally regulated by FMRP are over translated. The resulting over abundance of certain proteins results in reduced synaptic strength due to AMPA receptor trafficking abnormalities that lead, at least in part, to the fragile X phenotype.        
18410169	"Evidence for social anxiety and impaired social cognition in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          This study assessed social behavior in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the Fmr1 (tm1Cgr) or Fmr1 ""knockout"" (KO) mouse. Both the KO and wild-type (WT) mice preferred to be near a novel conspecific than to be alone. However, during the initial interaction with a novel conspecific, (1) a greater proportion of the KO mice exhibited high levels of grooming; and (2) the average duration of nose contact with the stimulus mouse was significantly shorter for the KO mice, both indicative of increased arousal and/or anxiety. Both groups exhibited a robust novelty preference when the novel animal was a ""preferred"" mouse. However, when the novel mouse was a ""nonpreferred"" animal, both groups showed a diminished novelty preference but this effect was more pronounced for the WT mice. This blunted negative reaction of the KO mice to a nonpreferred animal may indicate that they were less proficient than controls in distinguishing between positive and negative social interactions. These findings provide support for the use of this animal model to study the autistic features of FXS and autism spectrum disorders.        "
18410188	Social behavior phenotypes in fragile X syndrome, autism, and the Fmr1 knockout mouse: theoretical comment on McNaughton et al. (2008).          Comments on the article by C. H. McNaughton et al.. Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) show varying degrees of social behavior disturbances, from social anxiety to autism. This variability of social behavior phenotypes in FXS is likely to be due to interactions of Fmr1 with other gene variants and environmental factors during brain development, although very little is known about the specific genetic and neural mechanisms involved. The Fmr1 knockout mouse is an important experimental resource for elucidating the neural mechanisms of social anxiety, social reward, and social cognition. However, studies of social behavior phenotypes in the Fmr1 knockout mouse are still in early stages. McNaughton et al provide important new information on these phenotypes in the Fmr1 knockout mouse through their use of novel, detailed behavioral analysis to identify signs of increased social anxiety and social cognition deficits. Their significant refinements in measurement of social behavior phenotypes will help to advance future efforts to elucidate the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying social behavior disturbances in FXS and autism.        
25979787	Endocannabinoid-mediated improvement on a test of aversive memory in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.         FAAH, Fmr1 KO mice, Fragile X syndrome, Memory, Passive avoidance, Propofol Silencing the gene FMR1 in fragile X syndrome (FXS) with consequent loss of its protein product, FMRP, results in intellectual disability, hyperactivity, anxiety, seizure disorders, and autism-like behavior. In a mouse model (Fmr1 knockout (KO)) of FXS, a deficit in performance on the passive avoidance test of learning and memory is a robust phenotype. We report that drugs acting on the endocannabinoid (eCB) system can improve performance on this test. We present three lines of evidence: (1) Propofol (reported to inhibit fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity) administered 30 min after training on the passive avoidance test improved performance in Fmr1 KO mice but had no effect on wild type (WT). FAAH catalyzes the metabolism of the eCB, anandamide, so its inhibition should result in increased anandamide levels. (2) The effect of propofol was blocked by prior administration of the cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist AM-251. (3) Treatment with the FAAH inhibitor, URB-597, administered 30 min after training on the passive avoidance test also improved performance in Fmr1 KO mice but had no effect on WT. Our results indicate that the eCB system is involved in FXS and suggest that the eCB system is a promising target for treatment of FXS.          
25986746	Therapeutic Strategies in Fragile X Syndrome: From Bench to Bedside and Back.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited intellectual disability often associated with autism, is caused by the loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein. Tremendous progress in basic, preclinical, and translational clinical research has elucidated a variety of molecular-, cellular-, and system-level defects in FXS. This has led to the development of several promising therapeutic strategies, some of which have been tested in larger-scale controlled clinical trials. Here, we will summarize recent advances in understanding molecular functions of fragile X mental retardation protein beyond the well-known role as an mRNA-binding protein, and will describe current developments and emerging limitations in the use of the FXS mouse model as a preclinical tool to identify therapeutic targets. We will review the results of recent clinical trials conducted in FXS that were based on some of the preclinical findings, and discuss how the observed outcomes and obstacles will inform future therapy development in FXS and other autism spectrum disorders.         
23254376	Rescue of dendritic spine phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice with the mGluR5 antagonist AFQ056/Mavoglurant.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism. The disease is a result of lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein. Brain tissues of patients with FXS and mice with FMRP deficiency have shown an abnormal dendritic spine phenotype. We investigated the dendritic spine length and density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in 2-, 10-, and 25-week-old Fmr1 knockout (KO). Next, we studied the effects of long-term treatment with an mGluR5 antagonist, AFQ056/Mavoglurant, on the spine phenotype in adult Fmr1 KO mice. We observed alterations in the spine phenotype during development, with a decreased spine length in 2-week-old Fmr1 KO mice compared with age-match wild-type littermates, but with increased spine length in Fmr1 KO mice compared with 10- and 25-week-old wild-type controls. No difference was found in spine density at any age. We report a rescue of the abnormal spine length in adult Fmr1 KO mice after a long-term treatment with AFQ056/Mavoglurant. This finding suggests that long-term treatment at later stage is sufficient to reverse the structural spine abnormalities and represents a starting point for future studies aimed at improving treatments for FXS.        
23260144	Multiple autism-linked genes mediate synapse elimination via proteasomal degradation of a synaptic scaffold PSD-95.          The activity-dependent transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) induces excitatory synapse elimination in mouse neurons, which requires fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein implicated in human cognitive dysfunction and autism. We report here that protocadherin 10 (Pcdh10), an autism-spectrum disorders gene, is necessary for this process. MEF2 and FMRP cooperatively regulate the expression of Pcdh10. Upon MEF2 activation, PSD-95 is ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) and then binds to Pcdh10, which links it to the proteasome for degradation. Blockade of the Pcdh10-proteasome interaction inhibits MEF2-induced PSD-95 degradation and synapse elimination. In FMRP-lacking neurons, elevated protein levels of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α (EF1α), an Mdm2-interacting protein and FMRP target mRNA, sequester Mdm2 and prevent MEF2-induced PSD-95 ubiquitination and synapse elimination. Together, our findings reveal roles for multiple autism-linked genes in activity-dependent synapse elimination.          
26322075	"Changes in expression of the long non-coding RNA FMR4 associate with altered gene expression during differentiation of human neural precursor cells.         FMR4, Fragile X, MBD4, chromatin remodeling, differentiation, epigenetics, intellectual disability, lncRNA CGG repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are responsible for a family of associated disorders characterized by either intellectual disability and autism Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), or adult-onset neurodegeneration Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome. However, the FMR1 locus is complex and encodes several long non-coding RNAs, whose expression is altered by repeat expansion mutations. The role of these lncRNAs is thus far unknown; therefore we investigated the functionality of FMR4, which we previously identified. ""Full""-length expansions of the FMR1 triplet repeat cause silencing of both FMR1 and FMR4, thus we are interested in potential loss-of-function that may add to phenotypic manifestation of FXS. Since the two transcripts do not exhibit cis-regulation of one another, we examined the potential for FMR4 to regulate target genes at distal genomic loci using gene expression microarrays. We identified FMR4-responsive genes, including the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4 (MBD4). Furthermore, we found that in differentiating human neural precursor cells, FMR4 expression is developmentally regulated in opposition to expression of both FMR1 (which is expected to share a bidirectional promoter with FMR4) and MBD4. We therefore propose that FMR4's function is as a gene-regulatory lncRNA and that this transcript may function in normal development. Closer examination of FMR4 increases our understanding of the role of regulatory lncRNA and the consequences of FMR1 repeat expansions.         "
26110222	Hyperactivity and lack of social discrimination in the adolescent Fmr1 knockout mouse.          The aims of this study were to investigate behaviour relevant to human autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the fragile X syndrome in adolescent Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice and to evaluate the tissue levels of striatal monoamines. Fmr1 KO mice were evaluated in the open field, marble burying and three-chamber test for the presence of hyperactivity, anxiety, repetitive behaviour, sociability and observation of social novelty compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The Fmr1 KO mice expressed anxiety and hyperactivity in the open field compared with WT mice. This increased level of hyperactivity was confirmed in the three-chamber test. Fmr1 KO mice spent more time with stranger mice compared with the WT. However, after a correction for hyperactivity, their apparent increase in sociability became identical to that of the WT. Furthermore, the Fmr1 KO mice could not differentiate between a familiar or a novel mouse. Monoamines were measured by HPLC: Fmr1 KO mice showed an increase in the striatal dopamine level. We conclude that the fragile X syndrome model seems to be useful for understanding certain aspects of ASD and may have translational interest for studies of social behaviour when hyperactivity coexists in ASD patients.         
20804589	Taurine regulation of short term synaptic plasticity in fragile X mice.          Fragile X Syndrome is the most common known genetic cause of autism. The Fmr1-KO mouse, lacks the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and is used as a model of the syndrome. The core behavioral deficits of autism may be conceptualized either as excessive adherence to patterns as seen in repetitive actions and aberrant language, or as insensitivity to subtle but socially important changes in patterns. The hippocampus receives information from the entorhinal cortex and plays a crucial role in the processing of patterned information. To gain more insight into the physiological function of FMRP and the neuronal mechanisms underlying fragile X syndrome, we examined the electrophysiological response of the hippocampus to pair pulse stimulation as a measure of patterned information processing and how it is affected in the Fmr1-KO mouse.          
20809278	Autoimmune disease in mothers with the FMR1 premutation is associated with seizures in their children with fragile X syndrome.          An increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in family members of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been previously reported. ASD is also a common problem co-occurring in children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Why ASD occurs in some individuals with FXS, but not all, is largely unknown. Furthermore, in premutation carrier mothers, there is an increased risk for autoimmune diseases. This study compared the rate of ASD and other neurodevelopmental/behavioral problems in 61 children with FXS born to 41 carrier mothers who had autoimmune disease and in 97 children with FXS of 78 carrier mothers who did not have autoimmune disease. There were no significant differences in the mean age (9.61 ± 5.59 vs. 9.41 ± 6.31, P = 0.836), cognitive and adaptive functioning in children of mothers with and without autoimmune disease. Among children whose mothers had autoimmune disease, the odds ratio (OR) for ASD was 1.27 (95% CI 0.62-2.61, P = 0.5115). Interestingly, the OR for seizures and tics was 3.81 (95% CI 1.13-12.86, P = 0.031) and 2.94 (95% CI 1.19-7.24, P = 0.019), respectively, in children of mothers with autoimmune disease compared to children of mothers without autoimmune disease. In conclusion, autoimmune disease in carrier mothers was not associated with the presence of ASD in their children. However, seizures and tics were significantly increased in children of mothers with autoimmune disease. This suggests a potential new mechanism of seizure and tic exacerbation in FXS related to an intergenerational influence from autoimmunity in the carrier mother.        
30126171	Drosophila as a Model for Assessing the Function of RNA-Binding Proteins during Neurogenesis and Neurological Disease. C9orf72, Drosophila, FUS, Fmr1, RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brat, neurodegeneration, neurons, shep, spinal muscular atrophy An outstanding question in developmental neurobiology is how RNA processing events contribute to the regulation of neurogenesis. RNA processing events are increasingly recognized as playing fundamental roles in regulating multiple developmental events during neurogenesis, from the asymmetric divisions of neural stem cells, to the generation of complex and diverse neurite morphologies. Indeed, both asymmetric cell division and neurite morphogenesis are often achieved by mechanisms that generate asymmetric protein distributions, including post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms such as the transport of translationally silent messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and local translation of mRNAs within neurites. Additionally, defects in RNA splicing have emerged as a common theme in many neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the importance of RNA processing in maintaining neuronal circuitry. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play an integral role in splicing and post-transcriptional gene regulation, and mutations in RBPs have been linked with multiple neurological disorders including autism, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), and X-linked intellectual disability disorder. Despite their widespread nature and roles in neurological disease, the molecular mechanisms and networks of regulated target RNAs have been defined for only a small number of specific RBPs. This review aims to highlight recent studies in         Drosophila that have advanced our knowledge of how RBP dysfunction contributes to neurological disease.
30132892	Inhibition of GluN2A NMDA receptors ameliorates synaptic plasticity deficits in the Fmr1        -/y mouse model. Autism, Developmental Disability, Fragile X syndrome, GluN2A, Glutamate receptors, Intellectual Disability, Synaptic plasticity, neuropsychiatric diseases, tri-heteromeric NMDA receptors Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic condition that is the most common form of inherited intellectual impairment and causes a range of neurodevelopmental complications including learning disabilities and intellectual disability and shares many characteristics with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the FXS mouse model, Fmr1          -/y , impaired synaptic plasticity was restored by pharmacologically inhibiting GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors but not GluN2B-containing receptors. Similar results were obtained by crossing Fmr1-/y with GluN2A knock-out (Grin2A-/- ) mice. These results suggest that dampening the elevated levels of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors in Fmr1-/y mice has the potential to restore hyperexcitability of the neural circuitry to (a more) normal-like level of brain activity.
30135642	Stress Odorant Sensory Response Dysfunction in         Drosophila Fragile X Syndrome Mutants. Drosophila, Fragile X syndrome, IBMX, avoidance response, cAMP, cGMP, sensory response dysfunction Sensory processing dysfunction (SPD) is present in most patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Silencing expression of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (        FMR1) gene leads to Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common single gene cause of ID and ASD. Drosophila have a highly conserved FMR1 ortholog, dfmr1. dfmr1 mutants display cognitive and social defects reminiscent of symptoms seen in individuals with FXS. We utilized a robust behavioral assay for sensory processing of the Drosophila stress odorant (dSO) to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of SPD in FXS. Here, we show that dfmr1 mutant flies present significant defects in dSO response. We found that dfmr1 expression in mushroom bodies is required for dSO processing. We also show that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling via PKA is activated after exposure to dSO and that several drugs regulating both cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels significantly improved defects in dSO processing in dfmr1 mutant flies.
30137253	Involvement of Phosphodiesterase 2A Activity in the Pathophysiology of Fragile X Syndrome.          The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein involved in translational regulation of mRNAs that play key roles in synaptic morphology and plasticity. The functional absence of FMRP causes the fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism. No effective treatment is available for FXS. We recently identified the Phosphodiesterase 2A (Pde2a) mRNA as a prominent target of FMRP. PDE2A enzymatic activity is increased in the brain of Fmr1-KO mice, a recognized model of FXS, leading to decreased levels of cAMP and cGMP. Here, we pharmacologically inhibited PDE2A in Fmr1-KO mice and observed a rescue both of the maturity of dendritic spines and of the exaggerated hippocampal mGluR-dependent long-term depression. Remarkably, PDE2A blockade rescued the social and communicative deficits of both mouse and rat Fmr1-KO animals. Importantly, chronic inhibition of PDE2A in newborn Fmr1-KO mice followed by a washout interval, resulted in the rescue of the altered social behavior observed in adolescent mice. Altogether, these results reveal the key role of PDE2A in the physiopathology of FXS and suggest that its pharmacological inhibition represents a novel therapeutic approach for FXS.        
23148316	Dampened dopamine-mediated neuromodulation in prefrontal cortex of fragile X mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inheritable mental retardation caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene resulting in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The role of this protein in neurons is complex and its absence gives rise to diverse alterations in neuronal function leading to neurological disorders including mental retardation, hyperactivity, cognitive impairment, obsessive-compulsive behaviour, seizure activity and autism. FMRP regulates mRNA translation at dendritic spines where synapses are formed, and thus the lack of FMRP can lead to disruptions in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Many of these neurological deficits in FXS probably involve the prefrontal cortex, and in this study, we have focused on modulatory actions of dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex. Our data indicate that dopamine produces a long-lasting enhancement of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by D1-type receptors seen in wild-type mice; however, such enhancement is absent in the Fmr1 knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice. The facilitation of IPSCs produced by direct cAMP stimulation was unaffected in Fmr1 KO, but D1 receptor levels were reduced in these animals. Our results show significant disruption of dopaminergic modulation of synaptic transmission in the Fmr1 KO mice and this alteration in inhibitory activity may provide insight into potential targets for the rescue of deficits associated with FXS.        
26166728	Abnormal neuronal morphology and neurochemistry in the auditory brainstem of Fmr1 knockout rats.         FMRP, Fragile X, auditory, hearing, superior olive Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder affecting nearly one in 5000 newborn males and is a leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder. In addition to developmental delays and intellectual impairment, FXS is characterized by seizures, attention deficit, and hypersensitivity to visual, tactile and auditory stimuli. The Fmr1 gene encodes Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is abundant in neurons, binds select mRNAs and functions as a negative regulator of mRNA translation. A deficiency in FMRP, as in FXS and Fmr1 knockout (KO) animals, results in neuronal dysmorphology and altered synaptic function. Additionally, there is evidence for disruption of GABAergic circuits in subjects lacking FMRP. Our previous studies demonstrated widespread expression of FMRP in human auditory brainstem neurons. Given this observation, we hypothesized that FMRP is highly expressed in rat auditory brainstem neurons and that the auditory hypersensitivity characteristic of FXS results from dysfunction of brainstem networks secondary to decreased expression of FMRP. In our investigation of postnatal day 50 (P50) control rats, we found that FMRP was widely expressed in neurons of the superior olivary complex (SOC). In P50 Fmr1 KO rats, many SOC neurons had a smaller soma when compared to controls, indicative of abnormal neuronal morphology. Additionally, neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) were more round in Fmr1 KO rats. There was also reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in neurons of the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) and a reduction in the number of calretinin-immunoreactive terminals associated with neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Together, these findings support the conclusion that the auditory dysfunction characteristic of FXS arises, at least in part, from defective brainstem networks.           
26190969	In vivo synaptic transmission and morphology in mouse models of Tuberous sclerosis, Fragile X syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, and Costello syndrome.         autism spectrum disorders, calyx of Held, intellectual disability, juxtacellular recording, mTOR signaling cascade, short-term plasticity, synaptic morphology, synaptic transmission Defects in the rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Ras)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways are responsible for several neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are an important cause for intellectual disability; additional manifestations include autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and brain malformations. Changes in synaptic function are thought to underlie the neurological conditions associated with these syndromes. We therefore studied morphology and in vivo synaptic transmission of the calyx of Held synapse, a relay synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the auditory brainstem, in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Costello syndrome. Calyces from both Tsc1(+/-) and from Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice showed increased volume and surface area compared to wild-type (WT) controls. In addition, in Fmr1 KO animals a larger fraction of calyces showed complex morphology. In MNTB principal neurons of Nf1 (+/) (-) mice the average delay between EPSPs and APs was slightly smaller compared to WT controls, which could indicate an increased excitability. Otherwise, no obvious changes in synaptic transmission, or short-term plasticity were observed during juxtacellular recordings in any of the four lines. Our results in these four mutants thus indicate that abnormalities of mTOR or Ras signaling do not necessarily result in changes in in vivo synaptic transmission.         
19117905	Advances in the treatment of fragile X syndrome.          The FMR1 mutations can cause a variety of disabilities, including cognitive deficits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and other socioemotional problems, in individuals with the full mutation form (fragile X syndrome) and distinct difficulties, including primary ovarian insufficiency, neuropathy and the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, in some older premutation carriers. Therefore, multigenerational family involvement is commonly encountered when a proband is identified with a FMR1 mutation. Studies of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 pathway antagonists in animal models of fragile X syndrome have demonstrated benefits in reducing seizures, improving behavior, and enhancing cognition. Trials of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists are beginning with individuals with fragile X syndrome. Targeted treatments, medical and behavioral interventions, genetic counseling, and family supports are reviewed here.        
24338128	Translational regulation of NeuroD1 expression by FMRP: involvement in glutamatergic neuronal differentiation of cultured rat primary neural progenitor cells.          Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is encoded by Fmr1 gene in which mutation is known to cause fragile X syndrome characterized by mental impairment and other psychiatric symptoms similar to autism spectrum disorders. FMRP plays important roles in cellular mRNA biology such as transport, stability, and translation as an RNA-binding protein. In the present study, we identified potential role of FMRP in the neural differentiation, using cortical neural progenitor cells from Sprague-Dawley rat. We newly found NeuroD1, an essential regulator of glutamatergic neuronal differentiation, as a new mRNA target interacting with FMRP in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We also identified FMRP as a regulator of neuronal differentiation by modulating NeuroD1 expression. Down-regulation of FMRP by siRNA also increased NeuroD1 expression along with increased pre- and post-synaptic development of glutamatergic neuron, as evidenced by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. On the contrary, cells harboring FMRP over-expression construct showed decreased NeuroD1 expression. Treatment of cultured neural precursor cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid known as an inducer of hyper-glutamatergic neuronal differentiation, down-regulated the expression of FMRP, and induced NeuroD1 expression. Our study suggests that modulation of FMRP expression regulates neuronal differentiation by interaction with its binding target mRNA, and provides an example of the gene and environmental interaction regulating glutamatergic neuronal differentiation.         
24354947	EXPLAIN Fragile-X: an explorative, longitudinal study on the characterization, treatment pathways, and patient-related outcomes of Fragile X Syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by a mutation of the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Comprehensive data are lacking, however, on the characteristics and management patients with FXS in Germany.          
25311365	Increased CYFIP1 dosage alters cellular and dendritic morphology and dysregulates mTOR.          Rare maternally inherited duplications at 15q11-13 are observed in ~1% of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), making it among the most common causes of ASD. 15q11-13 comprises a complex region, and as this copy number variation encompasses many genes, it is important to explore individual genotype-phenotype relationships. Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1) is of particular interest because of its interaction with Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), its upregulation in transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with duplications at 15q11-13 and ASD and the presence of smaller overlapping deletions of CYFIP1 in patients with schizophrenia and intellectual disability. Here, we confirm that CYFIP1 is upregulated in transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and demonstrate its upregulation in the post-mortem brain from 15q11-13 duplication patients for the first time. To investigate how increased CYFIP1 dosage might predispose to neurodevelopmental disease, we studied the consequence of its overexpression in multiple systems. We show that overexpression of CYFIP1 results in morphological abnormalities including cellular hypertrophy in SY5Y cells and differentiated mouse neuronal progenitors. We validate these results in vivo by generating a BAC transgenic mouse, which overexpresses Cyfip1 under the endogenous promotor, observing an increase in the proportion of mature dendritic spines and dendritic spine density. Gene expression profiling on embryonic day 15 suggested the dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which was confirmed at the protein level. Importantly, similar evidence of mTOR-related dysregulation was seen in brains from 15q11-13 duplication patients with ASD. Finally, treatment of differentiated mouse neuronal progenitors with an mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin) rescued the morphological abnormalities resulting from CYFIP1 overexpression. Together, these data show that CYFIP1 overexpression results in specific cellular phenotypes and implicate modulation by mTOR signaling, further emphasizing its role as a potential convergent pathway in some forms of ASD.         
25844398	FMRP regulates neurogenesis         in vivo in Xenopus laevis tadpoles.  Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading known monogenic form of autism and the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. FXS results from silencing the         FMR1 gene during embryonic development, leading to loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA transport, stability, and translation. FXS is commonly thought of as a disease of synaptic dysfunction, however, FMRP expression is lost early in embryonic development, well before most synaptogenesis occurs. Recent studies suggest that loss of FMRP results in aberrant neurogenesis, but neurogenic defects have been variable. We investigated whether FMRP affects neurogenesis in Xenopus laevis tadpoles which express a homolog of FMR1. We used in vivo time-lapse imaging of neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny to evaluate the effect of acute loss or over-expression of FMRP on neurogenesis in the developing optic tectum. We complimented the time-lapse studies with SYTOX labeling to quantify apoptosis and CldU labeling to measure cell proliferation. Animals with increased or decreased levels of FMRP have significantly decreased neuronal proliferation and survival. They also have increased neuronal differentiation, but deficient dendritic arbor elaboration. The presence and severity of these defects was highly sensitive to FMRP levels. These data demonstrate that FMRP plays an important role in neurogenesis and suggest that endogenous FMRP levels are carefully regulated. These studies show promise in using Xenopus as an experimental system to study fundamental deficits in brain development with loss of FMRP and give new insight into the pathophysiology of FXS.
25849048	Quantitative profiling of brain lipid raft proteome in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X Syndrome, a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism, arises from transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene encoding an RNA-binding protein, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). FMRP can regulate the expression of approximately 4% of brain transcripts through its role in regulation of mRNA transport, stability and translation, thus providing a molecular rationale for its potential pleiotropic effects on neuronal and brain circuitry function. Several intracellular signaling pathways are dysregulated in the absence of FMRP suggesting that cellular deficits may be broad and could result in homeostatic changes. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of the plasma membrane, enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, involved in regulation of intracellular signaling. Among transcripts targeted by FMRP, a subset encodes proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and homeostasis, dysregulation of which could affect the integrity and function of lipid rafts. Using a quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach we analyzed the lipid raft proteome of Fmr1 knockout mice, an animal model of Fragile X syndrome, and identified candidate proteins that are differentially represented in Fmr1 knockout mice lipid rafts. Furthermore, network analysis of these candidate proteins reveals connectivity between them and predicts functional connectivity with genes encoding components of myelin sheath, axonal processes and growth cones. Our findings provide insight to aid identification of molecular and cellular dysfunctions arising from Fmr1 silencing and for uncovering shared pathologies between Fragile X syndrome and other autism spectrum disorders.         
25859182	Functional and structural deficits at accumbens synapses in a mouse model of Fragile X.         Fragile X, accumbens, autism, dendritic spines, spike timing-dependent plasticity, synaptic plasticity Fragile X is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and a leading cause of autism. The disease is caused by mutation of a single X-linked gene called fmr1 that codes for the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a 71 kDa protein, which acts mainly as a translation inhibitor. Fragile X patients suffer from cognitive and emotional deficits that coincide with abnormalities in dendritic spines. Changes in spine morphology are often associated with altered excitatory transmission and long-term plasticity, the most prominent deficit in fmr1-/y mice. The nucleus accumbens, a central part of the mesocortico-limbic reward pathway, is now considered as a core structure in the control of social behaviors. Although the socio-affective impairments observed in Fragile X suggest dysfunctions in the accumbens, the impact of the lack of FMRP on accumbal synapses has scarcely been studied. Here we report for the first time a new spike timing-dependent plasticity paradigm that reliably triggers NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory afferent inputs of medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the nucleus accumbens core region. Notably, we discovered that this LTP was completely absent in fmr1-/y mice. In the fmr1-/y accumbens intrinsic membrane properties of MSNs and basal excitatory neurotransmission remained intact in the fmr1-/y accumbens but the deficit in LTP was accompanied by an increase in evoked AMPA/NMDA ratio and a concomitant reduction of spontaneous NMDAR-mediated currents. In agreement with these physiological findings, we found significantly more filopodial spines in fmr1-/y mice by using an ultrastructural electron microscopic analysis of accumbens core medium spiny neuron spines. Surprisingly, spine elongation was specifically due to the longer longitudinal axis and larger area of spine necks, whereas spine head morphology and postsynaptic density size on spine heads remained unaffected in the fmr1-/y accumbens. These findings together reveal new structural and functional synaptic deficits in Fragile X.         
22641815	Signaling defects in iPSC-derived fragile X premutation neurons.          Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a leading monogenic neurodegenerative disorder affecting premutation carriers of the fragile X (FMR1) gene. To investigate the underlying cellular neuropathology, we produced induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from isogenic subclones of primary fibroblasts of a female premutation carrier, with each subclone bearing exclusively either the normal or the expanded (premutation) form of the FMR1 gene as the active allele. We show that neurons harboring the stably-active, expanded allele (EX-Xa) have reduced postsynaptic density protein 95 protein expression, reduced synaptic puncta density and reduced neurite length. Importantly, such neurons are also functionally abnormal, with calcium transients of higher amplitude and increased frequency than for neurons harboring the normal-active allele. Moreover, a sustained calcium elevation was found in the EX-Xa neurons after glutamate application. By excluding the individual genetic background variation, we have demonstrated neuronal phenotypes directly linked to the FMR1 premutation. Our approach represents a unique isogenic, X-chromosomal epigenetic model to aid the development of targeted therapeutics for FXTAS, and more broadly as a model for the study of common neurodevelopmental (e.g. autism) and neurodegenerative (e.g. Parkinsonism, dementias) disorders.        
24831882	New insights into the molecular pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome and therapeutic perspectives from the animal model.         Anxiety, Autism, CB1 cannabinoid receptor, Endocannabinoid system, Epilepsy, Fragile X syndrome, Intellectual disability, Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Nociception, mGluR5 Fragile X syndrome is the most common monogenetic form of intellectual disability and is a leading cause of autism. This syndrome is produced by the reduced transcription of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, and it is characterized by a range of symptoms heterogeneously expressed in patients such as cognitive impairment, seizure susceptibility, altered pain sensitivity and anxiety. The recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved have opened novel potential therapeutic approaches identified in preclinical rodent models as a necessary preliminary step for the subsequent evaluation in patients. Among those possible therapeutic approaches, the modulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling or the GABA receptor signaling have focused most of the attention. New findings in the animal models open other possible therapeutic approaches such as the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway or the endocannabinoid system. This review summarizes the emerging data recently obtained in preclinical models of fragile X syndrome supporting these new therapeutic perspectives.           
24848467	Deficient tonic GABAergic conductance and synaptic balance in the fragile X syndrome amygdala.         GABA, amygdala, fragile X syndrome, tonic inhibition Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability. Comorbidities of FXS such as autism are increasingly linked to imbalances in excitation and inhibition (E/I) as well as dysfunction in GABAergic transmission in a number of brain regions including the amygdala. However, the link between E/I imbalance and GABAergic transmission deficits in the FXS amygdala is poorly understood. Here we reveal that normal tonic GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in principal neurons (PNs) of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is comprised of both δ- and α5-subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Furthermore, tonic GABAergic capacity is reduced in these neurons in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS (1.5-fold total, 3-fold δ-subunit, and 2-fold α5-subunit mediated) as indicated by application of gabazine (50 μM), 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP, 1 μM), and α5ia (1.5 μM) in whole cell patch-clamp recordings. Moreover, α5-containing tonic GABAA receptors appear to preferentially modulate nonsomatic compartments of BLA PNs. Examination of evoked feedforward synaptic transmission in these cells surprisingly revealed no differences in overall synaptic conductance or E/I balance between wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. Instead, we observed altered feedforward kinetics in Fmr1 KO PNs that supports a subtle yet significant decrease in E/I balance at the peak of excitatory conductance. Blockade of α5-subunit-containing GABAA receptors replicated this condition in WT PNs. Therefore, our data suggest that tonic GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission can modulate synaptic E/I balance and timing established by feedforward inhibition and thus may represent a therapeutic target to enhance amygdala function in FXS.           
25383903	Dendritic channelopathies contribute to neocortical and sensory hyperexcitability in Fmr1(-/y) mice.          Hypersensitivity in response to sensory stimuli and neocortical hyperexcitability are prominent features of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorders, but little is known about the dendritic mechanisms underlying these phenomena. We found that the primary somatosensory neocortex (S1) was hyperexcited in response to tactile sensory stimulation in Fmr1(-/y) mice. This correlated with neuronal and dendritic hyperexcitability of S1 pyramidal neurons, which affect all major aspects of neuronal computation, from the integration of synaptic input to the generation of action potential output. Using dendritic electrophysiological recordings, calcium imaging, pharmacology, biochemistry and a computer model, we found that this defect was, at least in part, attributable to the reduction and dysfunction of dendritic h- and BKCa channels. We pharmacologically rescued several core hyperexcitability phenomena by targeting BKCa channels. Our results provide strong evidence pointing to the utility of BKCa channel openers for the treatment of the sensory hypersensitivity aspects of FXS.         
22435671	Reduction of BDNF expression in Fmr1 knockout mice worsens cognitive deficits but improves hyperactivity and sensorimotor deficits.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of inherited intellectual disability and a well-characterized form of autism spectrum disorder. As brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in the pathophysiology of FXS we examined the effects of reduced BDNF expression on the behavioral phenotype of an animal model of FXS, Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, crossed with mice carrying a deletion of one copy of the Bdnf gene (Bdnf(+/-)). Fmr1 KO mice showed age-dependent alterations in hippocampal BDNF expression that declined after the age of 4 months compared to wild-type controls. Mild deficits in water maze learning in Bdnf(+/-) and Fmr1 KO mice were exaggerated and contextual fear learning significantly impaired in double transgenics. Reduced BDNF expression did not alter basal nociceptive responses or central hypersensitivity in Fmr1 KO mice. Paradoxically, the locomotor hyperactivity and deficits in sensorimotor learning and startle responses characteristic of Fmr1 KO mice were ameliorated by reducing BNDF, suggesting changes in simultaneously and in parallel working hippocampus-dependent and striatum-dependent systems. Furthermore, the obesity normally seen in Bdnf(+/-) mice was eliminated by the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMRP). Reduced BDNF decreased the survival of newborn cells in the ventral part of the hippocampus both in the presence and absence of FMRP. Since a short neurite phenotype characteristic of newborn cells lacking FMRP was not found in cells derived from double mutant mice, changes in neuronal maturation likely contributed to the behavioral phenotype. Our results show that the absence of FMRP modifies the diverse effects of BDNF on the FXS phenotype.          
27293187	Peripheral Mechanosensory Neuron Dysfunction Underlies Tactile and Behavioral Deficits in Mouse Models of ASDs.          Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) commonly experience aberrant tactile sensitivity, yet the neural alterations underlying somatosensory dysfunction and the extent to which tactile deficits contribute to ASD characteristics are unknown. We report that mice harboring mutations in Mecp2, Gabrb3, Shank3, and Fmr1 genes associated with ASDs in humans exhibit altered tactile discrimination and hypersensitivity to gentle touch. Deletion of Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in peripheral somatosensory neurons causes mechanosensory dysfunction through loss of GABAA receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of inputs to the CNS. Remarkably, tactile defects resulting from Mecp2 or Gabrb3 deletion in somatosensory neurons during development, but not in adulthood, cause social interaction deficits and anxiety-like behavior. Restoring Mecp2 expression exclusively in the somatosensory neurons of Mecp2-null mice rescues tactile sensitivity, anxiety-like behavior, and social interaction deficits, but not lethality, memory, or motor deficits. Thus, mechanosensory processing defects contribute to anxiety-like behavior and social interaction deficits in ASD mouse models. PAPERCLIP.           
27294193	Behavioral Phenotype of Fmr1 Knock-Out Mice during Active Phase in an Altered Light/Dark Cycle.         activity, anxiety, circadian phase, fragile X, learning and memory, social behavior Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly inherited form of intellectual disability and is a disorder that is also highly associated with autism. FXS occurs as a result of an expanded CGG repeat sequence leading to transcriptional silencing. In an animal model of FXS in which Fmr1 is knocked out (Fmr1 KO), many physical, physiological, and behavioral characteristics of the human disease are recapitulated. Prior characterization of the mouse model was conducted during the day, the inactive phase of the circadian cycle. Circadian rhythms are an important contributor to behavior and may play a role in the study of disease phenotype. Moreover, changes in the parameters of circadian rhythm are known to occur in FXS animal models. We conducted an investigation of key behavioral phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice during their active phase. We report that phase did not alter the Fmr1 KO phenotype in open field activity, anxiety, and learning and memory. There was a slight effect of phase on social behavior as measured by time in chamber, but not by time spent sniffing. Our data strengthen the existing data characterizing the phenotype of Fmr1 KO mice, indicating that it is independent of circadian phase.         
27312842	"Fragile X Premutation Carrier Epidemiology and Symptomatology in Israel-Results from a Tertiary Child Developmental Center.         Carrier, FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X, Premutation Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent known genetically inherited cause for autism and intellectual disability. Premutation state can cause several clinical disorders as well. We aimed to perform a nesting approach to acquire data with regard to first degree relatives of index fragile X cases at the largest child development center in Israel in order to map characteristics of Israeli FXS permutation women carriers. Seventy-nine women were referred due to a related fragile X syndrome patient, mainly an offspring or sibling. General information regarding demographics, ethnicity, and associated medical conditions were collected using interviews and structured questionnaires. Thirteen (17 %) of the women who were referred as ""carrier"" were proven to be actually full mutation. The mean years of education were 14 (±1.51, range 12-17). Twenty-one women (27 %) originated from Tunisia (mainly from the island of Djerba). Ten women (13 %) reported delivery of their affected offspring beyond 41 gestational weeks. Twenty-two percent of women with premutation reported symptoms consistent with learning difficulties, mainly dyscalculia, and 14 % reported ADHD symptoms. Awareness about clinical disorders of the carriers was existent only in 25 % of the patients. Increased awareness and knowledge dissemination concerning premutation symptomatology and associated medical conditions are warranted. We suggest a national registry to be installed in different countries in order to identify fragile X premutation carriers at increased risk for various medical complications.        "
19025200	Checklist assessments of FMR1 gene mutation phenotypes.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) caused by the mutation of the FMR1 gene, is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, autism, and other psychoneurological disorders. Timely identification of young children with social or emotional challenges is urged in that emotional and social problems are often overlooked until problems reach serious magnitudes. Reliable methods of screening children at an earlier age are crucial to early intervention.          
17166801	Fragile-X syndrome and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome: two faces of FMR1.          Recent advances in our understanding of the clinical and molecular features of the fragile-X mental-retardation 1 gene, FMR1, highlight the importance of single-gene disorders. 15 years after its discovery, FMR1 continues to reveal new and unexpected clinical presentations and molecular mechanisms. Loss of function of FMR1 is a model for neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders, including mental retardation, autism, anxiety, and mood instability. In addition, overexpression and CNS toxicity of FMR1 mRNA causes a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). A similar mechanism is probably involved in premature ovarian failure, which affects up to 20% of female carriers of an altered FMR1 gene.        
17166860	Amygdala dysfunction in men with the fragile X premutation.          Premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are associated with autism spectrum disorder in childhood, premature ovarian failure, and the neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FXTAS, and perhaps the other clinical presentations among carriers, are thought to be due to toxic gain-of-function of elevated levels of the expanded-repeat FMR1 mRNA. Previous structural MRI studies have implicated the amygdala as a potential site of dysfunction underlying social deficits and/or risk for FXTAS. As a preliminary investigation of this possible association, adult males with the premutation, and male controls matched for IQ, age and education, completed three protocols that probe amygdala and sympathetic function: (i) a functional MRI paradigm that measures brain response to fearful faces; (ii) a fear-potentiated startle paradigm that differentiates responses to fearful faces and fearful non-social images and (iii) measurement of skin conductance level during a brief social encounter. Compared with controls, men with the FMR1 premutation demonstrated diminished brain activation in the amygdala and several brain areas that mediate social cognition while viewing fearful faces. The reduced amygdala activation in the premutation group was significantly associated with self-report of psychological symptoms on the Symptom Checklist-90--Revised. These men also displayed a lack of startle potentiation while viewing fearful faces and showed reduced skin conductance response when greeting an unfamiliar experimenter in comparison with the control group. The current findings may be related to social cognition deficits reported previously in children and adults with the premutation. The aetiology for this dysfunction may be elevated FMR1 mRNA or reduced FMR1 protein that occurs in carriers with higher premutation CGG repeat alleles.        
24008143	Developmental changes in expression of inhibitory neuronal proteins in the Fragile X Syndrome mouse basolateral amygdala.         Autism, Basolateral amygdala, Development, Fragile X Syndrome, GABA(A) receptor, Inhibitory synapse In humans, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is characterized by enhanced fear, hyperactivity, social anxiety, and, in a subset of individuals, autism. Many of the emotional and social deficits point to defects in the amygdala. We have previously shown defects in inhibitory neuron drive onto excitatory projection neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of juvenile Fmr1(-/y) knockout (KO) mice. Using pharmacological approaches, we have also previously revealed dynamic functional deficits in α1, α2, and α3 subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs α1, α2, and α3) during early postnatal development. In this study, we sought to determine whether these defects in GABAAR function are accompanied by changes in protein expression of GABAARs α1, α2, and α3 and the post-synaptic GABAAR-clustering protein gephyrin. Interestingly, we found that while the expression of these proteins did not significantly differ between wildtype (WT) and KO mice at each time point, the timing of developmental expression of GABAAR α1, α2, and gephyrin was altered. Collectively, these data reveal novel defects in inhibitory synapse protein expression during critical periods of early postnatal development that could contribute to observed inhibitory neurotransmission deficits in the KO mouse BLA.          
26888925	Selective Disruption of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5-Homer Interactions Mimics Phenotypes of Fragile X Syndrome in Mice.         Homer, LTD, UP states, fragile X syndrome, mGluR5, protein synthesis Altered function of the Gq-coupled, Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors, specifically mGlu5, is implicated in multiple mouse models of autism and intellectual disability. mGlu5 dysfunction has been most well characterized in the fragile X syndrome mouse model, the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, where pharmacological and genetic reduction of mGlu5 reverses many phenotypes. mGlu5 is less associated with its scaffolding protein Homer in Fmr1 KO mice, and restoration of mGlu5-Homer interactions by genetic deletion of a short, dominant negative of Homer, H1a, rescues many phenotypes of Fmr1 KO mice. These results suggested that disruption of mGlu5-Homer leads to phenotypes of FXS. To test this idea, we examined mice with a knockin mutation of mGlu5 (F1128R; mGlu5(R/R)) that abrogates binding to Homer. Although FMRP levels were normal, mGlu5(R/R) mice mimicked multiple phenotypes of Fmr1 KO mice, including reduced mGlu5 association with the postsynaptic density, enhanced constitutive mGlu5 signaling to protein synthesis, deficits in agonist-induced translational control, protein synthesis-independent LTD, neocortical hyperexcitability, audiogenic seizures, and altered behaviors, including anxiety and sensorimotor gating. These results reveal new roles for the Homer scaffolds in regulation of mGlu5 function and implicate a specific molecular mechanism in a complex brain disease.          
21090964	Toward fulfilling the promise of molecular medicine in fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation and a leading known cause of autism. It is caused by loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that negatively regulates protein synthesis. In neurons, multiple lines of evidence suggest that protein synthesis at synapses is triggered by activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs) and that many functional consequences of activating these receptors are altered in the absence of FMRP. These observations have led to the theory that exaggerated protein synthesis downstream of Gp1 mGluRs is a core pathogenic mechanism in FXS. This excess can be corrected by reducing signaling by Gp1 mGluRs, and numerous studies have shown that inhibition of mGluR5, in particular, can ameliorate multiple mutant phenotypes in animal models of FXS. Clinical trials based on this therapeutic strategy are currently under way. FXS is therefore poised to be the first neurobehavioral disorder in which corrective treatments have been developed from the bottom up: from gene identification to pathophysiology in animals to novel therapeutics in humans. The insights gained from FXS and other autism-related single-gene disorders may also assist in identifying molecular mechanisms and potential treatment approaches for idiopathic autism.        
21784246	FMRP stalls ribosomal translocation on mRNAs linked to synaptic function and autism.          FMRP loss of function causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic features. FMRP is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that it plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been little consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs. FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target mRNAs. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in FXS and ASD and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention.          
21795546	Abnormal presynaptic short-term plasticity and information processing in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading genetic cause of autism. It is associated with the lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a regulator of protein synthesis in axons and dendrites. Studies on FXS have extensively focused on the postsynaptic changes underlying dysfunctions in long-term plasticity. In contrast, the presynaptic mechanisms of FXS have garnered relatively little attention and are poorly understood. Activity-dependent presynaptic processes give rise to several forms of short-term plasticity (STP), which is believed to control some of essential neural functions, including information processing, working memory, and decision making. The extent of STP defects and their contributions to the pathophysiology of FXS remain essentially unknown, however. Here we report marked presynaptic abnormalities at excitatory hippocampal synapses in Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice leading to defects in STP and information processing. Loss of FMRP led to enhanced responses to high-frequency stimulation. Fmr1 KO mice also exhibited abnormal synaptic processing of natural stimulus trains, specifically excessive enhancement during the high-frequency spike discharges associated with hippocampal place fields. Analysis of individual STP components revealed strongly increased augmentation and reduced short-term depression attributable to loss of FMRP. These changes were associated with exaggerated calcium influx in presynaptic neurons during high-frequency stimulation, enhanced synaptic vesicle recycling, and enlarged readily-releasable and reserved vesicle pools. These data suggest that loss of FMRP causes abnormal STP and information processing, which may represent a novel mechanism contributing to cognitive impairments in FXS.        
21795626	Impaired inhibitory control of cortical synchronization in fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe cognitive impairments, sensory hypersensitivity, and comorbidities with autism and epilepsy. Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse models of FXS exhibit alterations in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, but it is largely unknown how aberrant function of specific neuronal subtypes contributes to these deficits. In this study we show specific inhibitory circuit dysfunction in layer II/III of somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. We demonstrate reduced activation of somatostatin-expressing low-threshold-spiking (LTS) interneurons in response to the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in Fmr1 KO mice, resulting in impaired synaptic inhibition. Paired recordings from pyramidal neurons revealed reductions in synchronized synaptic inhibition and coordinated spike synchrony in response to DHPG, indicating a weakened LTS interneuron network in Fmr1 KO mice. Together, these findings reveal a functional defect in a single subtype of cortical interneuron in Fmr1 KO mice. This defect is linked to altered activity of the cortical network in line with the FXS phenotype.        
28815939	Paternal transmission of a FMR1 full mutation allele.         FXS, full mutation, paternal transmission, somatic expansion Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism. In most of cases, the molecular basis of this syndrome is a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. It is inherited as an X linked dominant trait, with a reduced penetrance (80% for males and 30% for females). Full mutation (FM) expansion from premutated alleles (PM) is only acquired via maternal meiosis, while paternal transmission always remains in the PM range. We present a 16-year-old girl with a mild fragile X syndrome phenotype. FMR1 gene study showed that the patient inherited a mosaic premutation-full mutation with an unmethylated uninterrupted allele (175, >200 CGG) from her father. The father showed an 88 CGG uninterrupted unmethylated allele in blood and sperm cells. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a FMR1 mosaic premutation-full mutation allele inherited from a PM father. In our opinion, the most likely explanation could be a postzygotic somatic expansion. We can conclude that in rare cases of a child with a full mutation whose mother does not carry a premutation, the possibility of paternal transmission should be considered.          
28823556	Excess Translation of Epigenetic Regulators Contributes to Fragile X Syndrome and Is Alleviated by Brd4 Inhibition.         Brd4, FMRP, FXS, chromatin, histones Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. FXS results from the loss of function of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which represses translation of target transcripts. Most of the well-characterized target transcripts of FMRP are synaptic proteins, yet targeting these proteins has not provided effective treatments. We examined a group of FMRP targets that encode transcriptional regulators, particularly chromatin-associated proteins. Loss of FMRP in mice results in widespread changes in chromatin regulation and aberrant gene expression. To determine if targeting epigenetic factors could reverse phenotypes associated with the disorder, we focused on Brd4, a BET protein and chromatin reader targeted by FMRP. Inhibition of Brd4 function alleviated many of the phenotypes associated with FXS. We conclude that loss of FMRP results in significant epigenetic misregulation and that targeting transcription via epigenetic regulators like Brd4 may provide new treatments for FXS.          
28826631	Multifarious Functions of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein.         Fragile X syndrome (FXS), activity-dependent critical period, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), synapse, translation regulation Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a heritable intellectual and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), results from the loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). This neurodevelopmental disease state exhibits neural circuit hyperconnectivity and hyperexcitability. Canonically, FMRP functions as an mRNA-binding translation suppressor, but recent findings have enormously expanded its proposed roles. Although connections between burgeoning FMRP functions remain unknown, recent advances have extended understanding of its involvement in RNA, channel, and protein binding that modulate calcium signaling, activity-dependent critical period development, and the excitation-inhibition (E/I) neural circuitry balance. In this review, we contextualize 3 years of FXS model research. Future directions extrapolated from recent advances focus on discovering links between FMRP roles to determine whether FMRP has a multitude of unrelated functions or whether combinatorial mechanisms can explain its multifaceted existence.          
28829283	Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 Knockout Zebrafish Shows Precocious Development in Social Behavior.         fragile X mental retardation protein, shoaling preference behavior, social behavior, zebrafish Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a generally hereditary form of human mental retardation that is caused by triplet repeat expansion (CGG) mutation in fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene promoter and that results in the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. The common symptoms of FXS patients include learning disabilities, anxiety, autistic behaviors, as well as other behavioral abnormalities. Our previous results demonstrated the behavioral abnormalities in fmr1 knockout (KO) zebrafish such as fear memory impairment and autism-like behavior. Here, we studied the functional role of fmr1 gene on the development of social behavior by behavioral experiments, including shoaling behavior, shoaling preference, light/dark test, and novel tank task. Our results demonstrated that precocious development of shoaling behavior is found in fmr1 KO zebrafish without affecting the shoaling preference on conspecific zebrafish. The shoaling behavior appeared after 14 days postfertilization (dpf), and the level of shoaling elevated in fmr1 KO zebrafish. Furthermore, the fmr1 KO zebrafish at 28 dpf expressed higher anxiety level in novel tank task. These results suggest that the change of shoaling behavior in fmr1 KO zebrafish may result from hyperactivity and an increase of anxiety.        
17519220	Genome-wide expression profiling of lymphoblastoid cell lines distinguishes different forms of autism and reveals shared pathways.          Autism is a heterogeneous condition that is likely to result from the combined effects of multiple genetic factors interacting with environmental factors. Given its complexity, the study of autism associated with Mendelian single gene disorders or known chromosomal etiologies provides an important perspective. We used microarray analysis to compare the mRNA expression profile in lymphoblastoid cells from males with autism due to a fragile X mutation (FMR1-FM), or a 15q11-q13 duplication (dup(15q)), and non-autistic controls. Gene expression profiles clearly distinguished autism from controls and separated individuals with autism based on their genetic etiology. We identified 68 genes that were dysregulated in common between autism with FMR1-FM and dup(15q). We also identified a potential molecular link between FMR1-FM and dup(15q), the cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which was up-regulated in dup(15q) patients. We were able to confirm this link in vitro by showing common regulation of two other dysregulated genes, JAKMIP1 and GPR155, downstream of FMR1 or CYFIP1. We also confirmed the reduction of the Jakmip1 protein in Fmr1 knock-out mice, demonstrating in vivo relevance. Finally, we showed independent confirmation of roles for JAKMIP1 and GPR155 in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) by showing their differential expression in male sib pairs discordant for idiopathic ASD. These results provide evidence that blood derived lymphoblastoid cells gene expression is likely to be useful for identifying etiological subsets of autism and exploring its pathophysiology.        
24408886	Analysis of FMR1 deletion in a subpopulation of post-mitotic neurons in mouse cortex and hippocampus.         Fmr1, Fragile X Syndrome, Nse-Cre, autism, mental retardation, synaptic plasticity Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by mutation in a single gene, FMR1, which encodes an RNA-binding protein FMRP. FMRP is highly expressed in neurons and is hypothesized to have a role in synaptic structure, function, and plasticity by regulating mRNAs that encode pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice have been used as a model to study FXS. These mice have been reported to show a great degree of phenotypic variability based on the genetic background, environmental signals, and experimental methods. In this study, we sought to restrict FMRP deletion to two brain regions that have been implicated in FXS and autism. We show that ablating Fmr1 in differentiated neurons of hippocampus and cortex results in dendritic alterations and changes in synaptic marker intensity that are brain region specific. In our conditional mutant mice, FMRP-deleted neurons have activated AKT-mTOR pathway signaling in hippocampus but display no apparent behavioral phenotypes. These results highlight the importance of identifying additional factors that interact with Fmr1 to develop FXS.          
24423648	GABAergic circuit dysfunction in the Drosophila Fragile X syndrome model.         Associative learning, Calcium signaling, Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), Glutamic acid decarboxylase, Mushroom Body, Synapse Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of FMR1 gene function, is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. The FMR1 protein (FMRP) translational regulator mediates activity-dependent control of synapses. In addition to the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) hyperexcitation FXS theory, the GABA theory postulates that hypoinhibition is causative for disease state symptoms. Here, we use the Drosophila FXS model to assay central brain GABAergic circuitry, especially within the Mushroom Body (MB) learning center. All 3 GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subunits are reportedly downregulated in dfmr1 null brains. We demonstrate parallel downregulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting GABA synthesis enzyme, although GABAergic cell numbers appear unaffected. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) single-cell clonal studies show that dfmr1 null GABAergic neurons innervating the MB calyx display altered architectural development, with early underdevelopment followed by later overelaboration. In addition, a new class of extra-calyx terminating GABAergic neurons is shown to include MB intrinsic α/β Kenyon Cells (KCs), revealing a novel level of MB inhibitory regulation. Functionally, dfmr1 null GABAergic neurons exhibit elevated calcium signaling and altered kinetics in response to acute depolarization. To test the role of these GABAergic changes, we attempted to pharmacologically restore GABAergic signaling and assay effects on the compromised MB-dependent olfactory learning in dfmr1 mutants, but found no improvement. Our results show that GABAergic circuit structure and function are impaired in the FXS disease state, but that correction of hypoinhibition alone is not sufficient to rescue a behavioral learning impairment.           
23436049	Reorganization of circuits underlying cerebellar modulation of prefrontal cortical dopamine in mouse models of autism spectrum disorder.          Imaging, clinical, and pre-clinical studies have provided ample evidence for a cerebellar involvement in cognitive brain function including cognitive brain disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. We previously reported that cerebellar activity modulates dopamine release in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) via two distinct pathways: (1) cerebellum to mPFC via dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and (2) cerebellum to mPFC via glutamatergic projections from the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus (ThN md and vl). The present study compared functional adaptations of cerebello-cortical circuitry following developmental cerebellar pathology in a mouse model of developmental loss of Purkinje cells (Lurcher) and a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (Fmr1 KO mice). Fixed potential amperometry was used to measure mPFC dopamine release in response to cerebellar electrical stimulation. Mutant mice of both strains showed an attenuation in cerebellar-evoked mPFC dopamine release compared to respective wildtype mice. This was accompanied by a functional reorganization of the VTA and thalamic pathways mediating cerebellar modulation of mPFC dopamine release. Inactivation of the VTA pathway by intra-VTA lidocaine or kynurenate infusions decreased dopamine release by 50 % in wildtype and 20-30 % in mutant mice of both strains. Intra-ThN vl infusions of either drug decreased dopamine release by 15 % in wildtype and 40 % in mutant mice of both strains, while dopamine release remained relatively unchanged following intra-ThN md drug infusions. These results indicate a shift in strength towards the thalamic vl projection, away from the VTA. Thus, cerebellar neuropathologies associated with autism spectrum disorders may cause a reduction in cerebellar modulation of mPFC dopamine release that is related to a reorganization of the mediating neuronal pathways.        
23458504	Altered auditory processing in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          This study provides the first description of auditory cortical processing in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is a genetic cause of intellectual impairment and is an autism spectrum disorder. Human studies with auditory evoked potentials indicate that FXS is associated with abnormal auditory processing. The Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse is a useful model for studying FXS. The KO mice show acoustic hypersensitivity and propensity for audiogenic seizures, suggesting altered auditory responses. However, the nature of changes at the neuronal level is not known. Here we conducted in vivo single unit extracellular electrophysiology in the auditory cortex of urethane/xylazine-anesthetized Fmr1 KO mice in response to tones and frequency modulated (FM) sweeps. Using tones as stimuli, we report expanded frequency tuning, enhanced response magnitude, and more variable first spike latencies in Fmr1 KO mice compared to wild-type controls. FM sweep stimuli revealed altered sensitivity to the rate of frequency change indicating abnormal spectrotemporal processing. There was no difference in FM sweep direction selectivity. Consistent with studies of the somatosensory cortex, these data point to hyper-responsiveness of auditory neurons as a key processing abnormality in FXS. Auditory neural responses can serve as outcome measures in preclinical trials of therapeutics for FXS as well as serve as physiological probes to study their mechanisms of action.          
21669931	Neural circuit architecture defects in a Drosophila model of Fragile X syndrome are alleviated by minocycline treatment and genetic removal of matrix metalloproteinase.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by loss of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) product (FMRP), is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. FXS patients suffer multiple behavioral symptoms, including hyperactivity, disrupted circadian cycles, and learning and memory deficits. Recently, a study in the mouse FXS model showed that the tetracycline derivative minocycline effectively remediates the disease state via a proposed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition mechanism. Here, we use the well-characterized Drosophila FXS model to assess the effects of minocycline treatment on multiple neural circuit morphological defects and to investigate the MMP hypothesis. We first treat Drosophila Fmr1 (dfmr1) null animals with minocycline to assay the effects on mutant synaptic architecture in three disparate locations: the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), clock neurons in the circadian activity circuit and Kenyon cells in the mushroom body learning and memory center. We find that minocycline effectively restores normal synaptic structure in all three circuits, promising therapeutic potential for FXS treatment. We next tested the MMP hypothesis by assaying the effects of overexpressing the sole Drosophila tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP) in dfmr1 null mutants. We find that TIMP overexpression effectively prevents defects in the NMJ synaptic architecture in dfmr1 mutants. Moreover, co-removal of dfmr1 similarly rescues TIMP overexpression phenotypes, including cellular tracheal defects and lethality. To further test the MMP hypothesis, we generated dfmr1;mmp1 double null mutants. Null mmp1 mutants are 100% lethal and display cellular tracheal defects, but co-removal of dfmr1 allows adult viability and prevents tracheal defects. Conversely, co-removal of mmp1 ameliorates the NMJ synaptic architecture defects in dfmr1 null mutants, despite the lack of detectable difference in MMP1 expression or gelatinase activity between the single dfmr1 mutants and controls. These results support minocycline as a promising potential FXS treatment and suggest that it might act via MMP inhibition. We conclude that FMRP and TIMP pathways interact in a reciprocal, bidirectional manner.        
21671049	Treatment effects of stimulant medication in young boys with fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at Xq27.3 on the FMR1 gene. The majority of young boys with FXS display poor attention and hyperactivity that is disproportionate to their cognitive disability, and approximately 70% meet diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Psychopharmacology is employed with 82% of young males 5-17 years of age, with stimulant medication as the most common medication prescribed. This study evaluated the effects of stimulant medication on the academic performance, attention, motor activity, and psychophysiological arousal of boys with FXS, as well as the concordance of effects within individuals. Participants in this study included 12 boys with FXS who were treated with stimulants. Participants completed videotaped academic testing on two consecutive days and were randomly assigned to be off stimulants for 1 day and on stimulants the other day. On each day, multiple measures including academic performance, behavior regulation, and psychophysiological arousal were collected. Approximately 75% of participants performed better on attention and academic measures, and 70% showed improved physiological regulation while on stimulant medication. A high degree of concordance among measures was found. Lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but not age, correlated with greater improvements in in-seat behavior. IQ and age did not relate to on-task behaviors. The frequency and magnitude of response to stimulant medication in boys with FXS is higher than those reported for most children with non-specific intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder.        
30158855	Targeted Reactivation of         FMR1 Transcription in Fragile X Syndrome Embryonic Stem Cells. CRISPR-dCas9, Fragile X Syndrome, VP-192, human embryonic stem cells, nucleotide repeat expansion, transcriptional activation Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism. It results from expansion of a CGG nucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of         FMR1. Large expansions elicit repeat and promoter hyper-methylation, heterochromatin formation, FMR1 transcriptional silencing and loss of the Fragile X protein, FMRP. Efforts aimed at correcting the sequelae resultant from FMRP loss have thus far proven insufficient, perhaps because of FMRP's pleiotropic functions. As the repeats do not disrupt the FMRP coding sequence, reactivation of endogenous FMR1 gene expression could correct the proximal event in FXS pathogenesis. Here we utilize the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats/deficient CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR/dCas9) system to selectively re-activate transcription from the silenced FMR1 locus. Fusion of the transcriptional activator VP192 to dCas9 robustly enhances FMR1 transcription and increases FMRP levels when targeted directly to the CGG repeat in human cells. Using a previously uncharacterized FXS human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line which acquires transcriptional silencing with serial passaging, we achieved locus-specific transcriptional re-activation of FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression despite promoter and repeat methylation. However, these changes at the transcript level were not coupled with a significant elevation in FMRP protein expression in FXS cells. These studies demonstrate that directing a transcriptional activator to CGG repeats is sufficient to selectively reactivate FMR1 mRNA expression in Fragile X patient stem cells.
30176067	Quantitative proteomics of forebrain subcellular fractions in fragile X mental retardation 1 knockout mice following acute treatment with 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine: Relevance to developmental study of schizophrenia.         FMRP, FXS, MPEP, autism, brain, mGluR5, schizophrenia The fragile X mental retardation 1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mouse replicates behavioral deficits associated with autism, fragile X syndrome, and schizophrenia. Less is known whether protein expression changes are consistent with findings in subjects with schizophrenia. In the current study, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics to determine the protein expression of four subcellular fractions in the forebrains of Fmr1 KO mice vs. C57BL/6 J mice and the effect of a negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5-2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP)-on protein expression. Strain- and treatment-specific differential expression of proteins was observed, many of which have previously been observed in the brains of subjects with schizophrenia. Western blotting verified the direction and magnitude of change for several proteins in different subcellular fractions as follows: neurofilament light protein (NEFL) and 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) in the total homogenate; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2 (HNRNPC) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D0 (HNRNPD) in the nuclear fraction; excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and ras-related protein rab 3a (RAB3A) in the synaptic fraction; and ras-related protein rab 35 (RAB35) and neuromodulin (GAP43) in the rough endoplasmic reticulum fraction. Individuals with FXS do not display symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the biomarkers that have been identified suggest that the Fmr1 KO model could potentially be useful in the study of schizophrenia.          
21248685	TMS: using the theta-burst protocol to explore mechanism of plasticity in individuals with Fragile X syndrome and autism.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), also known as Martin-Bell Syndrome, is a genetic abnormality found on the X chromosome. Individuals suffering from FXS display abnormalities in the expression of FMR1--a protein required for typical, healthy neural development. Recent data has suggested that the loss of this protein can cause the cortex to be hyperexcitable thereby affecting overall patterns of neural plasticity. In addition, Fragile X shows a strong comorbidity with autism: in fact, 30% of children with FXS are diagnosed with autism, and 2-5% of autistic children suffer from FXS. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (a non-invasive neurostimulatory and neuromodulatory technique that can transiently or lastingly modulate cortical excitability via the application of localized magnetic field pulses) represents a unique method of exploring plasticity and the manifestations of FXS within affected individuals. More specifically, Theta-Burst Stimulation (TBS), a specific stimulatory protocol shown to modulate cortical plasticity for a duration up to 30 minutes after stimulation cessation in healthy populations, has already proven an efficacious tool in the exploration of abnormal plasticity. Recent studies have shown the effects of TBS last considerably longer in individuals on the autistic spectrum--up to 90 minutes. This extended effect-duration suggests an underlying abnormality in the brain's natural plasticity state in autistic individuals, similar to the hyperexcitability induced by Fragile X Syndrome. In this experiment, utilizing single-pulse motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as our benchmark, we will explore the effects of both intermittent and continuous TBS on cortical plasticity in individuals suffering from FXS and individuals on the Autistic Spectrum.        
16998604	Fmr1 KO mice as a possible model of autistic features.          Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder appearing before the age of 3, where communication and social interactions are impaired. It also entails stereotypic behavior or restricted interests. Although this disorder was first described in 1943, little is still known about its etiology and that of related developmental disorders. Work with human patients has provided many data on neuropathological and cognitive symptoms, but our understanding of the functional defects at the cellular level and how they come about remains sketchy. To improve this situation, autism research is in need of valid animal models. However, despite a strong hereditary component, attempts to identify genes have generally failed, suggesting that many different genes are involved. As a high proportion of patients suffering from the Fragile X Syndrome show many autistic symptoms, a mouse model of this disorder could potentially also serve as a model for autism. The Fmr1 KO mouse is a valid model of the Fragile X Syndrome and many data on behavioral and sensory-motor characteristics of this model have been gathered. We present here an assessment of autistic features in this candidate model. We conclude that Fmr1 KO mice display several autistic-like features, but more work is needed to validate this model.        
29291238	Developmental Emergence of Phenotypes in the Auditory Brainstem Nuclei of         Fmr1 Knockout Mice. auditory, brainstem, fragile x, lateral superior olive, medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, ventral cochlear nucleus: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of autism, is often associated with hypersensitivity to sound. Several studies have shown abnormalities in the auditory brainstem in FXS; however, the emergence of these auditory phenotypes during development has not been described. Here, we investigated the development of phenotypes in FXS model [        Fmr1 knockout (KO)] mice in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN), medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), and lateral superior olive (LSO). We studied features of the brainstem known to be altered in FXS or Fmr1 KO mice, including cell size and expression of markers for excitatory (VGLUT) and inhibitory (VGAT) synapses. We found that cell size was reduced in the nuclei with different time courses. VCN cell size is normal until after hearing onset, while MNTB and LSO show decreases earlier. VGAT expression was elevated relative to VGLUT in the Fmr1 KO mouse MNTB by P6, before hearing onset. Because glial cells influence development and are altered in FXS, we investigated their emergence in the developing Fmr1 KO brainstem. The number of microglia developed normally in all three nuclei in Fmr1 KO mice, but we found elevated numbers of astrocytes in Fmr1 KO in VCN and LSO at P14. The results indicate that some phenotypes are evident before spontaneous or auditory activity, while others emerge later, and suggest that Fmr1 acts at multiple sites and time points in auditory system development.
29292077	Proteomic Profiling of Brain and Testis Reveals the Diverse Changes in Ribosomal Proteins in fmr1 Knockout Mice.         FMRP, hippocampus, proteomics, ribosome, testis Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of inherited forms of mental retardation and autism, is caused by the transcriptional silencing of fmr1 encoding the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that is a widely expressed, but primarily in the brain and testis, and associated approximately 4% of transcripts. Macro-orchidism is a common symptom associated with FXS both in humans and mice. Thus, we analyze the pooled samples of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and testis from both the fmr1-KO and wild-type mice by a LC-MS/MS proteomic study. Among the identified proteins, most of those showing significant changes in expression were up- or downregulated in the absence of FMRP. Proteins (FMRP, RPS8, RPL23a and ATPIF1, RPL6, GAP43, MTCH2 and MPZ in brain, and FMRP, CAH3, AKR1B7 and C9 in testis) identified by MS/MS were also verified by Western blotting. The Gene Ontology and WikiPathways analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were clustered in the polyribosome and RNA-binding protein categories in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but not in testis. Although this study was limited by the little number of samples, our results provide detailed insights into the ribosomal protein profiles of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and testis in the absence of FMRP. Our studies also provide a better understanding of protein profile changes and the underlying dysregulated pathways arising from fmr1 silencing in FXS.          
29317220	Acamprosate rescues neuronal defects in the Drosophila model of Fragile X Syndrome.         Autism, Bouton, Bruchpilot, CPB53E, Drug dosage, FXS, Larval locomotion, NMJ, Neurobiology, Neuromuscular junction, Synapse, dFMR1, dFMRP Several off-label studies have shown that acamprosate can provide some clinical benefits in youth with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), an autism spectrum disorder caused by loss of function of the highly conserved FMR1 gene. This study investigated the ability of acamprosate to rescue cellular, molecular and behavioral defects in the Drosophila model of FXS.          
23352156	Fragile X syndrome therapeutics: translation, meet translational medicine.          Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability and autism, is thought to occur due to abnormal regulation of neuronal protein synthesis. A study by Osterweil et al. (2013), in this issue, demonstrates that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin can normalize protein synthesis and also reduce audiogenic seizures in Fmr1 knockout mice.          
9358013	Molecular and cytogenetic investigations of the fragile X region including the Frax A and Frax E CGG trinucleotide repeat sequences in families multiplex for autism and related phenotypes.          We undertook molecular and cytogenetic analyses in 25 families multiplex for autism and related disorders. Three of the multiplex families exhibited fragile X, and the affected offspring all exhibited CGG triplet repeat insertion mutations in the FMR-1 gene. One of these families contained an affected pair of monozygotic female twins. Both had similar-sized CGG triplet repeat expansions, but different phenotypic manifestations. One suffered from autism and the other from mild mental retardation and marked social anxiety. PCR and Southern hybridization analysis of the CGG repeat sequences characterizing fragile X A (Frax A) and E and the methylation status of FMR-1 showed no evidence of abnormal CGG repeat expansion or FMR-1 hypermethylation in the remaining 22 multiplex families. Moreover, there was no correlation between the Frax A or E (CGG)n repeat length with affected status, nor any association with the low-level (< 3 %) expression of cytogenetic fragility at Xq27 previously reported in these families. Our findings indicate that most instances of recurrence in families multiplex for autism and related disorders are not accounted for by Frax A and E. They also indicate that the phenotypic manifestations of Frax A may be influenced by stochastic, environmental and other biological factors.        
24318628	Intense and specialized dendritic localization of the fragile X mental retardation protein in binaural brainstem neurons: a comparative study in the alligator, chicken, gerbil, and human.         brain evolution, dendritic regulation, fragile X syndrome, low-frequency temporal processing, medial superior olive, nucleus laminaris Neuronal dendrites are structurally and functionally dynamic in response to changes in afferent activity. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an mRNA binding protein that regulates activity-dependent protein synthesis and morphological dynamics of dendrites. Loss and abnormal expression of FMRP occur in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and some forms of autism spectrum disorders. To provide further understanding of how FMRP signaling regulates dendritic dynamics, we examined dendritic expression and localization of FMRP in the reptilian and avian nucleus laminaris (NL) and its mammalian analogue, the medial superior olive (MSO), in rodents and humans. NL/MSO neurons are specialized for temporal processing of low-frequency sounds for binaural hearing, which is impaired in FXS. Protein BLAST analyses first demonstrate that the FMRP amino acid sequences in the alligator and chicken are highly similar to human FMRP with identical mRNA-binding and phosphorylation sites, suggesting that FMRP functions similarly across vertebrates. Immunocytochemistry further reveals that NL/MSO neurons have very high levels of dendritic FMRP in low-frequency hearing vertebrates including alligator, chicken, gerbil, and human. Remarkably, dendritic FMRP in NL/MSO neurons often accumulates at branch points and enlarged distal tips, loci known to be critical for branch-specific dendritic arbor dynamics. These observations support an important role for FMRP in regulating dendritic properties of binaural neurons that are essential for low-frequency sound localization and auditory scene segregation, and support the relevance of studying this regulation in nonhuman vertebrates that use low frequencies in order to further understand human auditory processing disorders.          
20937127	Open-label add-on treatment trial of minocycline in fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a disorder characterized by a variety of disabilities, including cognitive deficits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and other socio-emotional problems. It is hypothesized that the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to higher levels of matrix metallo-proteinase-9 activity (MMP-9) in the brain. Minocycline inhibits MMP-9 activity, and alleviates behavioural and synapse abnormalities in fmr1 knockout mice, an established model for FXS. This open-label add-on pilot trial was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of minocycline in treating behavioural abnormalities that occur in humans with FXS.          
16511373	Lessons from fragile X regarding neurobiology, autism, and neurodegeneration.          The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) mutation causes two disorders: fragile X syndrome (FXS) in those with the full mutation and the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in some older individuals with the premutation. FXS is caused by a deficiency of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) leading to dysregulation of many genes that create a phenotype with ADHD, anxiety, and autism. FXTAS is caused by the elevation of FMR1-mRNA to levels 2 to 8 times normal in the premutation. This causes an RNA gain of function toxicity leading to brain atrophy, white matter disease, neuronal and astrocytic inclusion formation, and subsequent ataxia, intention tremor, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive decline. The neurobiology and pathophysiology of FXS and FXTAS are described in detail.        
30056576	Neuroligin 1, 2, and 3 Regulation at the Synapse: FMRP-Dependent Translation and Activity-Induced Proteolytic Cleavage.         FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, Local translation, Neuroligins, Proteolysis, Synapse Neuroligins (NLGNs) are cell adhesion molecules located on the postsynaptic side of the synapse that interact with their presynaptic partners neurexins to maintain trans-synaptic connection. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common neurodevelopmental disease that often co-occurs with autism and is caused by the lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. To gain an insight into the molecular interactions between the autism-related genes, we sought to determine whether FMRP controls the synaptic levels of NLGNs. We show evidences that FMRP associates with Nlgn1, Nlgn2, and Nlgn3 mRNAs in vitro in both synaptoneurosomes and neuronal cultures. Next, we confirm local translation of Nlgn1, Nlgn2, and Nlgn3 mRNAs to be synaptically regulated by FMRP. As a consequence of elevated Nlgns mRNA translation Fmr1 KO mice exhibit increased incorporation of NLGN1 and NLGN3 into the postsynaptic membrane. Finally, we show that neuroligins synaptic level is precisely and dynamically regulated by their rapid proteolytic cleavage upon NMDA receptor stimulation in both wild type and Fmr1 KO mice. In aggregate, our study provides a novel approach to understand the molecular basis of FXS by linking the dysregulated synaptic expression of NLGNs with FMRP.        
23778581	mRNA and protein expression for novel GABAA receptors θ and ρ2 are altered in schizophrenia and mood disorders; relevance to FMRP-mGluR5 signaling pathway.          Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that targets ∼5% of all mRNAs expressed in the brain. Previous work by our laboratory demonstrated significantly lower protein levels for FMRP in lateral cerebella of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression when compared with controls. Absence of FMRP expression in animal models of fragile X syndrome (FXS) has been shown to reduce expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor mRNAs. Previous work by our laboratory has found reduced expression of FMRP, as well as multiple GABAA and GABAB receptor subunits in subjects with autism. Less is known about levels for GABAA subunit protein expression in brains of subjects with schizophrenia and mood disorders. In the current study, we have expanded our previous studies to examine the protein and mRNA expression of two novel GABAA receptors, theta (GABRθ) and rho 2 (GABRρ2) as well as FMRP, and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in lateral cerebella of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and healthy controls, and in superior frontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9 (BA9)) of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and healthy controls. We observed multiple statistically significant mRNA and protein changes in levels of GABRθ, GABRρ2, mGluR5 and FMRP molecules including concordant reductions in mRNA and proteins for GABRθ and mGluR5 in lateral cerebella of subjects with schizophrenia; for increased mRNA and protein for GABRρ2 in lateral cerebella of subjects with bipolar disorder; and for reduced mRNA and protein for mGluR5 in BA9 of subjects with bipolar disorder. There were no significant effects of confounds on any of the results.        
29785777	Paradoxical effect of baclofen on social behavior in the fragile X syndrome mouse model.         FMR1, baclofen, fragile X mental retardation protein, fragile X syndrome, targeted treatment, γ-aminobutyric acid Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common monogenetic cause of intellectual disability, autism spectrum features, and a broad range of other psychiatric and medical problems. FXS is caused by the lack of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a translational regulator of specific mRNAs at the postsynaptic compartment. The absence of FMRP leads to aberrant synaptic plasticity, which is believed to be caused by an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory network functioning of the synapse. Evidence from studies in mice demonstrates that GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and its receptors, is involved in the pathogenesis of FXS. Moreover, several FXS phenotypes, including social behavior deficits, could be corrected in Fmr1 KO mice after acute treatment with GABA          B agonists.
29796988	The Fragile X Protein and Genome Function.         Chromatin, DNA damage repair, FMRP, Fragile X mental retardation, Genome stability The fragile X syndrome (FXS) arises from loss of expression or function of the FMR1 gene and is one of the most common monogenic forms of intellectual disability and autism. During the past two decades of FXS research, the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) has been primarily characterized as a cytoplasmic RNA binding protein that facilitates transport of select RNA substrates through neural projections and regulation of translation within synaptic compartments, with the protein products of such mRNAs then modulating cognitive functions. However, the presence of a small fraction of FMRP in the nucleus has long been recognized. Accordingly, recent studies have uncovered several mechanisms or pathways by which FMRP influences nuclear gene expression and genome function. Some of these pathways appear to be independent of the classical role for FMRP as a regulator of translation and point to novel functions, including the possibility that FMRP directly participates in the DNA damage response and in the maintenance of genome stability. In this review, we highlight these advances and discuss how these new findings could contribute to our understanding of FMRP in brain development and function, the neural pathology of fragile X syndrome, and perhaps impact of future therapeutic considerations.        
21547712	Fragile x syndrome and autism: from disease model to therapeutic targets.          Autism is an umbrella diagnosis with several different etiologies. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), one of the first identified and leading causes of autism, has been modeled in mice using molecular genetic manipulation. These Fmr1 knockout mice have recently been used to identify a new putative therapeutic target, the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), for the treatment of FXS. Moreover, mGluR5 signaling cascades interact with a number of synaptic proteins, many of which have been implicated in autism, raising the possibility that therapeutic targets identified for FXS may have efficacy in treating multiple other causes of autism.        
21548960	Dysregulation of fragile × mental retardation protein and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in superior frontal cortex of individuals with autism: a postmortem brain study.          Fragile × syndrome is caused by loss of function of the fragile × mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and shares multiple phenotypes with autism. We have previously found reduced expression of the protein product of FMR1 (FMRP) in vermis of adults with autism.          
24773431	Fmr1 and Nlgn3 knockout rats: novel tools for investigating autism spectrum disorders.          Animal models are critical for gaining insights into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite their apparent advantages to mice for neural studies, rats have not been widely used for disorders of the human CNS, such as ASD, for the lack of convenient genome manipulation tools. Here we describe two of the first transgenic rat models for ASD, developed using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) methodologies, and their initial behavioral assessment using a rapid juvenile test battery. A syndromic and nonsyndromic rat model for ASD were created as two separate knockout rat lines with heritable disruptions in the genes encoding Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Neuroligin3 (NLGN3). FMRP, a protein with numerous proposed functions including regulation of mRNA and synaptic protein synthesis, and NLGN3, a member of the neuroligin synaptic cell-adhesion protein family, have been implicated in human ASD. Juvenile subjects from both knockout rat lines exhibited abnormalities in ASD-relevant phenotypes including juvenile play, perseverative behaviors, and sensorimotor gating. These data provide important first evidence regarding the utility of rats as genetic models for investigating ASD-relevant genes.        
22738402	High-functioning autism spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome: report of two affected sisters.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (ID), as well as the most frequent monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Men with FXS exhibit ID, often associated with autistics features, whereas women heterozygous for the full mutation are typically less severely affected; about half have a normal or borderline intelligence quotient (IQ). Previous findings have shown a strong association between ID and ASD in both men and women with FXS. We describe here the case of two sisters with ASD and FXS but without ID. One of the sisters presented with high-functioning autism, the other one with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and low normal IQ.          
22767137	Identification of expanded alleles of the FMR1 Gene in the CHildhood Autism Risks from Genes and Environment (CHARGE) study.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat (>200 repeats) in the 5'UTR of the fragile X mental retardation gene, is the single most prevalent cause of cognitive disabilities. Several screening studies for FXS, among individuals with ID from different ethnic populations, have indicated that the prevalence of the syndrome varies between 0.5 and 16 %. Because the high co-morbidity with autism, we have conducted a screening study of the cohort from CHARGE, a large-scale, population-based, case control study. We have identified six subjects carrying an expanded allele, which emphasize the importance of screening for FXS in a population with intellectual disabilities and ASD.        
8844082	Mosaicism for the FMR1 gene influences adaptive skills development in fragile X-affected males.          Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common forms of inherited mental retardation, and the first of a new class of genetic disorders associated with expanded trinucleotide repeats. Previously, we found that about 41% of affected males are mosaic for this mutation in that some of their blood cells have an active fragile X gene and others do not. It has been hypothesized that these mosaic cases should show higher levels of functioning than those who have only the inactive full mutation gene, but previous studies have provided negative or equivocal results. In the present study, the cross-sectional development of communication, self-care, socialization, and motor skills was studied in 46 males with fragile X syndrome under age 20 years as a function of two variables: age and the presence or absence of mosaicism. The rate of adaptive skills development was 2-4 times as great in mosaic cases as in full mutation cases. There was also a trend for cases with autism to be more prevalent in the full-mutation group. These results have implications for prognosis, for the utility of gene or protein replacement therapies for this disorder, and for understanding the association between mental retardation, developmental disorders, and fragile X syndrome.        
8844091	Lack of expansion of triplet repeats in the FMR1, FRAXE, and FRAXF loci in male multiplex families with autism and pervasive developmental disorders.          Sib, twin, and family studies have shown that a genetic cause exists in many cases of autism, with a portion of cases associated with a fragile X chromosome. Three folate-sensitive fragile sites in the Xq27-->Xq28 region have been cloned and found to have polymorphic trinucleotide repeats at the respective sites; these repeats are amplified and methylated in individuals who are positive for the different fragile sites. We have tested affected boys and their mothers from 19 families with two autistic/PDD boys for amplification and/or instability of the triplet repeats at these loci and concordance of inheritance of alleles by affected brothers. In all cases, the triplet repeat numbers were within the normal range, with no individuals having expanded or premutation-size alleles. For each locus, there was no evidence for an increased frequency of concordance, indicating that mutations within these genes are unlikely to be responsible for the autistic/PDD phenotypes in the affected boys. Thus, we think it is important to retest those autistic individuals who were cytogenetically positive for a fragile X chromosome, particularly cases where there is no family history of the fragile X syndrome, using the more accurate DNA-based testing procedures.        
25258334	A complex Xp11.22 deletion in a patient with syndromic autism: exploration of FAM120C as a positional candidate gene for autism.         FAM120C, X-linked, autism spectrum disorder, candidate gene, deletion We present a male patient with sporadic Aarskog syndrome, cleft palate, mild intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A submicroscopic discontiguous deletion was detected on chromosome Xp11.2 encompassing FGD1, FAM120C, and PHF8. That the deletion encompassed FGD1 (exons 2-8) explains the Aarskog features while the deletion of PHF8 most likely explains the cleft palate and mild intellectual disability. We identify FAM120C as a novel X-linked candidate gene for autism for two reasons: first, a larger deletion encompassing FAM120C segregates with autism in a previously reported family and second, there is recent evidence that FAM120C interacts with CYFIP1, part of the FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein) network. In the current study, resequencing of FAM120C in 87 Belgian male patients with autism spectrum disorder identified no novel mutations. Expression of Fam120c in mouse tissues showed enriched expression in pituitary, cerebellum, cortex, and pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Additionally, we found a cortical expression pattern of Fam120c similar to that of Fmr1. In conclusion, FAM120C is a novel candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder based on genetic evidence and the brain expression pattern. Thereby we highlight a role for FMRP network genes in ASD.          
25258535	Modulation of the GABAergic pathway for the treatment of fragile X syndrome.         arbaclofen, autism, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, ganaxolone, targeted treatments Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and the most common single-gene cause of autism. It is caused by mutations on the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) and lack of fragile X mental retardation protein, which in turn, leads to decreased inhibition of translation of many synaptic proteins. The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) hypothesis states that the neurological deficits in individuals with FXS are due mainly to downstream consequences of overstimulation of the mGluR pathway. The main efforts have focused on mGluR5 targeted treatments; however, investigation on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system and its potential as a targeted treatment is less emphasized. The fragile X mouse models (Fmr1-knock out) show decreased GABA subunit receptors, decreased synthesis of GABA, increased catabolism of GABA, and overall decreased GABAergic input in many regions of the brain. Consequences of the reduced GABAergic input in FXS include oversensitivity to sensory stimuli, seizures, and anxiety. Deficits in the GABA receptors in different regions of the brain are associated with behavioral and attentional processing deficits linked to anxiety and autistic behaviors. The understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has led to the development of targeted treatments for the core behavioral features of FXS, which include social deficits, inattention, and anxiety. These symptoms are also observed in individuals with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, therefore the targeted treatments for FXS are leading the way in the treatment of other neurodevelopmental syndromes and autism. The GABAergic system in FXS represents a target for new treatments. Herein, we discuss the animal and human trials of GABAergic treatment in FXS. Arbaclofen and ganaxolone have been used in individuals with FXS. Other potential GABAergic treatments, such as riluzole, gaboxadol, tiagabine, and vigabatrin, will be also discussed. Further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of GABAergic treatments for FXS.         
22405502	Genetic manipulation of STEP reverses behavioral abnormalities in a fragile X syndrome mouse model.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and prevailing known genetic basis of autism, is caused by an expansion in the Fmr1 gene that prevents transcription and translation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP binds to and controls translation of mRNAs downstream of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation. Recent work shows that FMRP interacts with the transcript encoding striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP; Ptpn5). STEP opposes synaptic strengthening and promotes synaptic weakening by dephosphorylating its substrates, including ERK1/2, p38, Fyn and Pyk2, and subunits of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA receptors. Here, we show that basal levels of STEP are elevated and mGluR-dependent STEP synthesis is absent in Fmr1(KO) mice. We hypothesized that the weakened synaptic strength and behavioral abnormalities reported in FXS may be linked to excess levels of STEP. To test this hypothesis, we reduced or eliminated STEP genetically in Fmr1(KO) mice and assessed mice in a battery of behavioral tests. In addition to attenuating audiogenic seizures and seizure-induced c-Fos activation in the periaqueductal gray, genetically reducing STEP in Fmr1(KO) mice reversed characteristic social abnormalities, including approach, investigation and anxiety. Loss of STEP also corrected select nonsocial anxiety-related behaviors in Fmr1(KO) mice, such as light-side exploration in the light/dark box. Our findings indicate that genetically reducing STEP significantly diminishes seizures and restores select social and nonsocial anxiety-related behaviors in Fmr1(KO) mice, suggesting that strategies to inhibit STEP activity may be effective for treating patients with FXS.          
15900222	Genetic linkage analysis of the X chromosome in autism, with emphasis on the fragile X region.          The higher prevalence of autism in males than in females suggests the possible involvement of the X chromosome. To test the hypothesis that there are mutations increasing susceptibility to autism on the X chromosome, and in particular the distal portion of the long arm that encompasses the FMRI and MECP2 loci, a genetic linkage study was performed. Twenty-two fragile X-negative families multiplex for autism and related disorders were used for the study. Linkage analysis, for markers in the Xq27-q28 region, using model-free likelihood-based analysis, produced a maximum MLOD of 1.7 for the narrowest diagnostic category of the typical autism/severe autism spectrum, and nonparametric analysis produced a maximum non-parametric lod (NPL) score of 2.1 for a broad phenotype diagnostic model. Thus, this study offers modest support for a susceptibility locus for autism within the Xq27-q28 region. Further genetic investigations of this region are warranted.        
23719910	Characterizing social behavior in genetically targeted mouse models of brain disorders.          Fragile X syndrome, the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders worldwide, is caused by a tandem repeat expansion in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene. It presents with a distinct behavioral phenotype which overlaps significantly with that of autism. Emerging evidence suggests that tandem repeat polymorphisms (TRPs) might also play a key role in modulating disease susceptibility for a range of common polygenic disorders, including the broader autism spectrum of disorders (ASD) and other forms of psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder [1]. In order to understand how TRPs and associated gene mutations mediate pathogenesis, various mouse models have been generated. A crucial step in such functional genomics is high-quality behavioral and cognitive phenotyping. This chapter presents a basic behavioral battery for standardized tests for assaying social phenotypes in mouse models of brain disorders, with a focus on aggression.        
23723176	Increasing our understanding of human cognition through the study of Fragile X Syndrome.         FMRP, FXR1P, FXR2P, Fragile X Syndrome, cognition, connectivity, local protein synthesis, plasticity, synapses Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is considered the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. It is caused by reductions in the expression level or function of a single protein, the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a translational regulator which binds to approximately 4% of brain messenger RNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that FXS is a complex disorder of cognition, involving interactions between genetic and environmental influences, leading to difficulties in acquiring key life skills including motor skills, language, and proper social behaviors. Since many FXS patients also present with one or more features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), insights gained from studying the monogenic basis of FXS could pave the way to a greater understanding of underlying features of multigenic ASDs. Here we present an overview of the FXS and FMRP field with the goal of demonstrating how loss of a single protein involved in translational control affects multiple stages of brain development and leads to debilitating consequences on human cognition. We also focus on studies which have rescued or improved FXS symptoms in mice using genetic or therapeutic approaches to reduce protein expression. We end with a brief description of how deficits in translational control are implicated in FXS and certain cases of ASDs, with many recent studies demonstrating that ASDs are likely caused by increases or decreases in the levels of certain key synaptic proteins. The study of FXS and its underlying single genetic cause offers an invaluable opportunity to study how a single gene influences brain development and behavior.          
26047724	The potential role of melatonin on sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairments: implication of FMRP on cognitive function.         FMRP, glia, learning and memory, melatonin, oxidative stress, sleep deprivation While prolonged sleep deprivation (SD) could lead to profound negative health consequences, such as impairments in vital biological functions of immunity and cognition, melatonin possesses powerful ameliorating effects against those harmful insults. Melatonin has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that help to restore body's immune and cognitive functions. In this study, we investigated the possible role of melatonin in reversing cognitive dysfunction induced by SD in rats. Our experimental results revealed that sleep-deprived animals exhibited spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze tasks compared with the control groups. Furthermore, there was an increased glial activation most prominent in the hippocampal region of the SD group compared to the normal control (NC) group. Additionally, markers of oxidative stress such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine (8-oxo-dG) were significantly increased, while fragile X-mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression was decreased in the SD group. Interestingly, melatonin treatment normalized these events to control levels following SD. Our data demonstrate that SD induces oxidative stress through glial activation and decreases FMRP expression in the neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest the efficacy of melatonin for the treatment of sleep-related neuronal dysfunction, which occurs in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and autism.          
24875778	Alterations of visual and auditory evoked potentials in fragile X syndrome.         Auditory evoked potential, Autism, Fragile X syndrome, Intellectual disability, Sensory information processing, Visual evoked potential Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic form of intellectual disability and one of the few known monogenic causes of autism. It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 ('Fragile X Mental Retardation 1') gene, which prevents expression of the 'Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein' (FMRP). In FXS, the absence of FMRP leads to altered structural and functional development of the synapse, while preventing activity-based synapse maturation and synaptic pruning, which are essential for normal brain development and cognitive development. Possible impairments in information processing can be non-invasively investigated using electrophysiology.          
24876161	Analysis of FMRP mRNA target datasets reveals highly associated mRNAs mediated by G-quadruplex structures formed via clustered WGGA sequences.          Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability and a well-known cause of autism spectrum disorder, is the result of loss or dysfunction of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a highly selective RNA-binding protein and translation regulator. A major research priority has been the identification of the mRNA targets of FMRP, particularly as recent studies suggest an excess of FMRP targets among genes implicated in idiopathic autism and schizophrenia. Several large-scale studies have attempted to identify mRNAs bound by FMRP through several methods, each generating a list of putative target genes, leading to distinct hypotheses by which FMRP recognizes its targets; namely, by RNA structure or sequence. However, no in depth analyses have been performed to identify the level of consensus among the studies. Here, we analyze four large FMRP target datasets to generate high-confidence consensus lists, and examine all datasets for sequence elements within the target RNAs to validate reported FMRP binding motifs (GACR, ACUK and WGGA). We found GACR to be highly enriched in FMRP datasets, while ACUK was not. The WGGA pattern was modestly enriched in several, but not all datasets. The previous association between FMRP and G-quadruplexes prompted the analysis of the distribution of WGGA in the target genes. Consistent with the requirements for G-quadruplex formation, we observed highly clustered WGGA motifs in FMRP targets compared with other genes, implicating both RNA structure and sequence in the recognition motif of FMRP. In addition, we generate a list of the top 40 FMRP targets associated with FXS-related phenotypes.           
18321984	Drosophila fragile X mental retardation protein developmentally regulates activity-dependent axon pruning.          Fragile X Syndrome (FraX) is a broad-spectrum neurological disorder with symptoms ranging from hyperexcitability to mental retardation and autism. Loss of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene product, the mRNA-binding translational regulator FMRP, causes structural over-elaboration of dendritic and axonal processes, as well as functional alterations in synaptic plasticity at maturity. It is unclear, however, whether FraX is primarily a disease of development, a disease of plasticity or both: a distinction that is vital for engineering intervention strategies. To address this crucial issue, we have used the Drosophila FraX model to investigate the developmental function of Drosophila FMRP (dFMRP). dFMRP expression and regulation of chickadee/profilin coincides with a transient window of late brain development. During this time, dFMRP is positively regulated by sensory input activity, and is required to limit axon growth and for efficient activity-dependent pruning of axon branches in the Mushroom Body learning/memory center. These results demonstrate that dFMRP has a primary role in activity-dependent neural circuit refinement during late brain development.        
17376973	Fragile X mental retardation protein induces synapse loss through acute postsynaptic translational regulation.          Fragile X syndrome, as well as other forms of mental retardation and autism, is associated with altered dendritic spine number and structure. Fragile X syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that regulates protein synthesis in vivo. It is unknown whether FMRP plays a direct, cell-autonomous role in regulation of synapse number, function, or maturation. Here, we report that acute postsynaptic expression of FMRP in Fmr1 knock-out (KO) neurons results in a decrease in the number of functional and structural synapses without an effect on their synaptic strength or maturational state. Similarly, neurons endogenously expressing FMRP (wild-type) have fewer synapses than neighboring Fmr1 KO neurons. An intact K homology domain 2 (KH2) RNA-binding domain and dephosphorylation of FMRP at S500 were required for the effects of FMRP on synapse number, indicating that FMRP interaction with RNA and translating polyribosomes leads to synapse loss.        
23083736	Genetic removal of p70 S6 kinase 1 corrects molecular, synaptic, and behavioral phenotypes in fragile X syndrome mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of autism and intellectual disability. Aberrant synaptic translation has been implicated in the etiology of FXS, but most lines of research on therapeutic strategies have targeted protein synthesis indirectly, far upstream of the translation machinery. We sought to perturb p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a key translation initiation and elongation regulator, in FXS model mice. We found that genetic reduction of S6K1 prevented elevated phosphorylation of translational control molecules, exaggerated protein synthesis, enhanced mGluR-dependent long-term depression (LTD), weight gain, and macro-orchidism in FXS model mice. In addition, S6K1 deletion prevented immature dendritic spine morphology and multiple behavioral phenotypes, including social interaction deficits, impaired novel object recognition, and behavioral inflexibility. Our results support the model that dysregulated protein synthesis is the key causal factor in FXS and that restoration of normal translation can stabilize peripheral and neurological function in FXS.          
27355445	Broad autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in adults with the fragile X premutation.         Social cognition, broad autism spectrum phenotype, fragile X premutation, obsessive–compulsive disorder Clinical observations and a limited number of research studies provide evidence that the fragile X premutation may confer risk for autism, executive dysfunction, and psychopathology. The link to autism spectrum symptoms and social cognition deficits with the premutation remains uncertain, and thus was the focus of the present investigation.          
27365114	"Perturbed proteostasis in autism spectrum disorders.         ASD/ID, autism, proteasome, synaptic plasticity, translation, ubiquitin Dynamic changes in synaptic strength rely on de novo protein synthesis and protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Disruption of either of these cellular processes will result in significant impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Mutations in several genes encoding regulators of mRNA translation and members of the UPS have been associated with an increased risk for the development of autism spectrum disorders. It is possible that these mutations result in a similar imbalance in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) at the synapse. This review will summarize recent work investigating the role of the UPS in synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses, and propose that dysfunctional proteostasis is a common consequence of several genetic mutations linked to autism spectrum disorders. Dynamic changes in synaptic strength rely on de novo protein synthesis and protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Disruption of either of these cellular processes will result in significant impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Mutations in several genes encoding regulators of mRNA translation (i.e. FMR1) and protein degradation (i.e. UBE3A) have been associated with an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability (ASD/ID). These mutations similarly disrupt protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Compensatory changes that reset the rate of proteostasis may contribute to the neurological symptoms of ASD/ID. This review summarizes recent work investigating the role of the UPS in synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses, and proposes that dysfunctional proteostasis is a common consequence of several genetic mutations linked to ASD. This article is part of a mini review series: ""Synaptic Function and Dysfunction in Brain Diseases"".          "
24733999	CYFIP family proteins between autism and intellectual disability: links with Fragile X syndrome.         CYFIP family proteins, F-actin, Fragile X, WAVE complex, autism, dendritic spines, intellectual disability Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have in common alterations in some brain circuits and brain abnormalities, such as synaptic transmission and dendritic spines morphology. Recent studies have indicated a differential expression for specific categories of genes as a cause for both types of disease, while an increasing number of genes is recognized to produce both disorders. An example is the Fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1), whose silencing causes the Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of ID and autism, also characterized by physical hallmarks. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the protein encoded by FMR1, is an RNA-binding protein with an important role in translational control. Among the interactors of FMRP, CYFIP1/2 (cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein) proteins are good candidates for ID and autism, on the bases of their genetic implication and functional properties, even if the precise functional significance of the CYFIP/FMRP interaction is not understood yet. CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 represent a link between Rac1, the WAVE (WAS protein family member) complex and FMRP, favoring the cross talk between actin polymerization and translational control.         
24737721	Topological methods reveal high and low functioning neuro-phenotypes within fragile X syndrome.         MRI, autism spectrum behavior, multivariate pattern analysis, topological data analysis, voxel-based morphometry Fragile X syndrome (FXS), due to mutations of the FMR1 gene, is the most common known inherited cause of developmental disability as well as the most common single-gene risk factor for autism. Our goal was to examine variation in brain structure in FXS with topological data analysis (TDA), and to assess how such variation is associated with measures of IQ and autism-related behaviors. To this end, we analyzed imaging and behavioral data from young boys (n = 52; aged 1.57-4.15 years) diagnosed with FXS. Application of topological methods to structural MRI data revealed two large subgroups within the study population. Comparison of these subgroups showed significant between-subgroup neuroanatomical differences similar to those previously reported to distinguish children with FXS from typically developing controls (e.g., enlarged caudate). In addition to neuroanatomy, the groups showed significant differences in IQ and autism severity scores. These results suggest that despite arising from a single gene mutation, FXS may encompass two biologically, and clinically separable phenotypes. In addition, these findings underscore the potential of TDA as a powerful tool in the search for biological phenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders.          
22384253	Glutamate induces the elongation of early dendritic protrusions via mGluRs in wild type mice, but not in fragile X mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited from of autism and mental impairment, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene, resulting in the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons in affected individuals are abnormally immature and in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice they are also abnormally unstable. This could result in defects in synaptogenesis, because spine dynamics are critical for synapse formation. We have previously shown that the earliest dendritic protrusions, which are highly dynamic and might serve an exploratory role to reach out for axons, elongate in response to glutamate. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this process is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and that it is defective in Fmr1 KO mice. Using time-lapse imaging with two-photon microscopy in acute brain slices from early postnatal mice, we find that early dendritic protrusions in layer 2/3 neurons become longer in response to application of glutamate or DHPG, a Group 1 mGluR agonist. Blockade of mGluR5 signaling, which reverses some adult phenotypes of KO mice, prevented the glutamate-mediated elongation of early protrusions. In contrast, dendritic protrusions from KO mice failed to respond to glutamate. Thus, absence of FMRP may impair the ability of cortical pyramidal neurons to respond to glutamate released from nearby pre-synaptic terminals, which may be a critical step to initiate synaptogenesis and stabilize spines.        
29859980	Loss of Sodium-Activated Potassium Channel Slack and FMRP Differentially Affect Social Behavior in Mice.         FMRP, Fragile-X-Syndrome, Slo2.2, autism-spectrum disorder, slack, social behavior The sodium-activated potassium channel Slack (Slo2.2) is widely expressed in central and peripheral neurons where it is supposed to shape firing properties important for neuronal excitability. Slack activity is enhanced by interaction with the Fragile-X-Mental-Retardation-Protein (FMRP) and loss of FMRP leads to decreased sodium-activated potassium currents in medial nucleus of the trapezoid body neurons of the Fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse representing a mouse model of the human Fragile-X-Syndrome (FXS) and autism. Autism is a frequent comorbidity of FXS, but it is unclear whether Slack is involved in autistic or related conditions of FXS in vivo. By applying a wide range of behavioral tests, we compared social and autism-related behaviors in Slack- and FMRP-deficient mice. In our hands, as expected, FMRP-deficiency causes autism-related behavioral changes in nesting and in a marble-burying test. In contrast, Slack-deficient males exhibited specific abnormalities in sociability in direct and indirect social interaction tests. Hence, we show for the first time that a proper Slack channel function is mandatory for normal social behavior in mice. Nevertheless, as deficits in social behaviors seem to occur independently from each other in FMRP and Slack null mutants, we conclude that Slack is not involved in the autistic phenotype of FMRP KO mice.          
22017584	Molecular mechanisms of fragile X syndrome: a twenty-year perspective.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of inherited intellectual disability and is one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of the trinucleotide CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the X-linked gene FMR1. This expansion leads to DNA methylation of FMR1 and to transcriptional silencing, which results in the absence of the gene product, FMRP, a selective messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein that regulates the translation of a subset of dendritic mRNAs. FMRP is critical for mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptor)-dependent long-term depression, as well as for other forms of synaptic plasticity; its absence causes excessive and persistent protein synthesis in postsynaptic dendrites and dysregulated synaptic function. Studies continue to refine our understanding of FMRP's role in synaptic plasticity and to uncover new functions of this protein, which have illuminated therapeutic approaches for FXS.        
22022567	Epigenetic characterization of the FMR1 gene and aberrant neurodevelopment in human induced pluripotent stem cell models of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability. In addition to cognitive deficits, FXS patients exhibit hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties, anxiety, and other autistic-like behaviors. FXS is caused by an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) gene leading to epigenetic silencing and loss of expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation protein (FMRP). Despite the known relationship between FMR1 CGG repeat expansion and FMR1 silencing, the epigenetic modifications observed at the FMR1 locus, and the consequences of the loss of FMRP on human neurodevelopment and neuronal function remain poorly understood. To address these limitations, we report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from multiple patients with FXS and the characterization of their differentiation into post-mitotic neurons and glia. We show that clones from reprogrammed FXS patient fibroblast lines exhibit variation with respect to the predominant CGG-repeat length in the FMR1 gene. In two cases, iPSC clones contained predominant CGG-repeat lengths shorter than measured in corresponding input population of fibroblasts. In another instance, reprogramming a mosaic patient having both normal and pre-mutation length CGG repeats resulted in genetically matched iPSC clonal lines differing in FMR1 promoter CpG methylation and FMRP expression. Using this panel of patient-specific, FXS iPSC models, we demonstrate aberrant neuronal differentiation from FXS iPSCs that is directly correlated with epigenetic modification of the FMR1 gene and a loss of FMRP expression. Overall, these findings provide evidence for a key role for FMRP early in human neurodevelopment prior to synaptogenesis and have implications for modeling of FXS using iPSC technology. By revealing disease-associated cellular phenotypes in human neurons, these iPSC models will aid in the discovery of novel therapeutics for FXS and other autism-spectrum disorders sharing common pathophysiology.        
29367010	Chronic minocycline treatment improves hippocampal neuronal structure, NMDA receptor function, and memory processing in Fmr1 knockout mice.         Behaviour, Fragile X Syndrome, Hippocampus, Minocycline, NMDA, Synaptic plasticity Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, and is the leading known single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS patients display varied behavioural deficits that include mild to severe cognitive impairments in addition to mood disorders. Currently there is no cure for this condition, however minocycline is becoming commonly prescribed as a treatment for FXS patients. Minocycline has been reported to alleviate social behavioural deficits, and improve verbal functioning in patients with FXS; however, its mode of action is not well understood. Previously we have shown that FXS results in learning impairments that involve deficits in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Here we tested whether chronic treatment with minocycline can improve these deficits by enhancing NMDA receptor-dependent functional and structural plasticity in the DG. Minocycline treatment resulted in a significant enhancement in NMDA receptor function in the dentate granule cells. This was accompanied by an increase in PSD-95 and GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in hippocampal synaptoneurosome fractions. Minocycline treatment also enhanced dentate granule cell dendritic length and branching. In addition, our results show that chronic minocycline treatment can rescue performance in novel object recognition in FXS mice. These findings indicate that minocycline treatment has both structural and functional benefits for hippocampal cells, which may partly contribute to the pro-cognitive effects minocycline appears to have for treating FXS.          
29375310	Negative Effects of Chronic Rapamycin Treatment on Behavior in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.         Fragile X, anxiety, hyperactivity, learning and memory, mTORC1, rapamycin, sleep, social behavior Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, is also highly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is caused by expansion of a CGG repeat sequence on the X chromosome resulting in silencing of the         FMR1 gene. This is modeled in the mouse by deletion of Fmr1 (Fmr1 KO). Fmr1 KO mice recapitulate many of the behavioral features of the disorder including seizure susceptibility, hyperactivity, impaired social behavior, sleep problems, and learning and memory deficits. The mammalian target of rapamycin pathway (mTORC1) is upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and is thought to be important for the pathogenesis of this disorder. We treated Fmr1 KO mice chronically with an mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, to determine if rapamycin treatment could reverse behavioral phenotypes. We performed open field, zero maze, social behavior, sleep, passive avoidance, and audiogenic seizure testing. We found that pS6 was upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and normalized by rapamycin treatment, but, except for an anxiogenic effect, it did not reverse any of the behavioral phenotypes examined. In fact, rapamycin treatment had an adverse effect on sleep and social behavior in both control and Fmr1 KO mice. These results suggest that targeting the mTOR pathway in FXS is not a good treatment strategy and that other pathways should be considered.
29379191	Genetic cluster of fragile X syndrome in a Colombian district.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disabilities and autism. The reported prevalence of the full mutation (FM) gene FMR1 in the general population is 0.2-0.4 per 1000 males and 0.125-0.4 per 1000 females. Population screening for FMR1 expanded alleles has been performed in newborns and in an adult population. However, it has never been carried out in an entire town. Ricaurte is a Colombian district with 1186 habitants, with a high prevalence of FXS, which was first described by cytogenetic techniques in 1999.          
20519966	An assay for social interaction in Drosophila fragile X mutants.          We developed a novel assay to examine social interactions in Drosophila and, as a first attempt, apply it here at examining the behavior of Drosophila Fragile X Mental Retardation gene (dfmr1) mutants. Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of single gene intellectual disability (ID) and is frequently associated with autism. Our results suggest that dfmr1 mutants are less active than wild-type flies and interact with each other less often. In addition, mutants for one allele of dfmr1, dfmr1(B55), are more likely to come in close contact with a wild-type fly than another dfmr1(B55) mutant. Our results raise the possibility of defective social expression with preserved receptive abilities. We further suggest that the assay may be applied in a general strategy of examining endophenoypes of complex human neurological disorders in Drosophila, and specifically in order to understand the genetic basis of social interaction defects linked with ID.        
20534533	Characterization and reversal of synaptic defects in the amygdala in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common inherited form of mental impairment and autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Earlier studies have identified a role for aberrant synaptic plasticity mediated by the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in FXS. However, many of these observations are derived primarily from studies in the hippocampus. The strong emotional symptoms of FXS, on the other hand, are likely to involve the amygdala. Unfortunately, little is known about how exactly FXS affects synaptic function in the amygdala. Here, using whole-cell recordings in brain slices from adult Fmr1 knockout mice, we find mGluR-dependent long-term potentiation to be impaired at thalamic inputs to principal neurons in the lateral amygdala. Consistent with this long-term potentiation deficit, surface expression of the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR1, is reduced in the lateral amygdala of knockout mice. In addition to these postsynaptic deficits, lower presynaptic release was manifested by a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), increased paired-pulse ratio, and slower use-dependent block of NMDA receptor currents. Strikingly, pharmacological inactivation of mGluR5 with 2-methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP) fails to rescue either the deficit in long-term potentiation or surface GluR1. However, the same acute MPEP treatment reverses the decrease in mEPSC frequency, a finding of potential therapeutic relevance. Therefore, our results suggest that synaptic defects in the amygdala of knockout mice are still amenable to pharmacological interventions against mGluR5, albeit in a manner not envisioned in the original hippocampal framework.        
20534828	Delayed stabilization of dendritic spines in fragile X mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) causes mental impairment and autism through transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene, resulting in the loss of the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Cortical pyramidal neurons in affected individuals and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice have an increased density of dendritic spines. The mutant mice also show defects in synaptic and experience-dependent circuit plasticity, which are known to be mediated in part by dendritic spine dynamics. We used in vivo time-lapse imaging with two-photon microscopy through cranial windows in male and female neonatal mice to test the hypothesis that dynamics of dendritic protrusions are altered in KO mice during early postnatal development. We find that layer 2/3 neurons from wild-type mice exhibit a rapid decrease in dendritic spine dynamics during the first 2 postnatal weeks, as immature filopodia are replaced by mushroom spines. In contrast, KO mice show a developmental delay in the downregulation of spine turnover and in the transition from immature to mature spine subtypes. Blockade of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling, which reverses some adult phenotypes of KO mice, accentuated this immature protrusion phenotype in KO mice. Thus, absence of FMRP delays spine stabilization and dysregulated mGluR signaling in FXS may partially normalize this early synaptic defect.        
14981523	Sensorimotor gating abnormalities in young males with fragile X syndrome and Fmr1-knockout mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single gene (FMR1) disorder affecting cognitive and behavioral function in humans. This syndrome is characterized by a cluster of abnormalities including lower IQ, attention deficits, impairments in adaptive behavior and increased incidence of autism. Here, we show that young males with FXS have profound deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI), a basic marker of sensorimotor gating that has been extensively studied in rodents. Importantly, the magnitude of the PPI impairments in the fragile X children predicted the severity of their IQ, attention, adaptive behavior and autistic phenotypes. Additionally, these measures were highly correlated with each other, suggesting that a shared mechanism underlies this complex phenotypic cluster. Studies in Fmr1-knockout mice also revealed sensorimotor gating and learning abnormalities. However, PPI and learning were enhanced rather than reduced in the mutants. Therefore, these data show that mutations of the FMR1 gene impact equivalent processes in both humans and mice. However, since these phenotypic changes are opposite in direction, they also suggest that murine compensatory mechanisms following loss of FMR1 function differ from those in humans.        
15000256	Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the FMR1 gene in autistic and mentally retarded children in Japan.          Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in males, and patients with fragile X syndrome occasionally develop autism. It is usually caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, but in a small number of patients deletions and point mutations have been identified. We screened all 17 exons of the FMR1 gene for mutations in 90 autistic or mentally retarded children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. No mutations were found in 76 male patients. However, one female patient was heterozygous for a normal allele and a mutant allele with an A to C substitution at nucleotide 879 in exon 9. This mutation was not found in 50 controls. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the mutant transcripts were spliced aberrantly, causing premature termination of the protein synthesis. Although uncommon, point mutations in the FMR1 gene may be a cause of autism and mental retardation in Japanese patients.        
30319351	New Insights Into the Role of Ca        v2 Protein Family in Calcium Flux Deregulation in Fmr1-KO Neurons. Cacna1a, Cav2.1, Fragile X syndrome, calcium homeostasis, ratiometric calcium imaging Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and a leading cause of autism, results from the loss of expression of the         Fmr1 gene which encodes the RNA-binding protein Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among the thousands mRNA targets of FMRP, numerous encode regulators of ion homeostasis. It has also been described that FMRP directly interacts with Ca2+ channels modulating their activity. Collectively these findings suggest that FMRP plays critical roles in Ca2+ homeostasis during nervous system development. We carried out a functional analysis of Ca2+ regulation using a calcium imaging approach in Fmr1-KO cultured neurons and we show that these cells display impaired steady state Ca2+ concentration and an altered entry of Ca2+ after KCl-triggered depolarization. Consistent with these data, we show that the protein product of the Cacna1a gene, the pore-forming subunit of the Cav2.1 channel, is less expressed at the plasma membrane of Fmr1-KO neurons compared to wild-type (WT). Thus, our findings point out the critical role that Cav2.1 plays in the altered Ca2+ flux in Fmr1-KO neurons, impacting Ca2+ homeostasis of these cells. Remarkably, we highlight a new phenotype of cultured Fmr1-KO neurons that can be considered a novel cellular biomarker and is amenable to small molecule screening and identification of new drugs to treat FXS.
26547130	First glimpses of the neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder.          Rapid progress in identifying the genes underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has provided the substrate for a first wave of analyses into the underlying neurobiology. This review describes the consensus across these diverse analyses, highlighting two distinct sets of genes: 1) Genes that regulate chromatin and transcription, especially in cortical projection neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons during mid-fetal development; and 2) Genes involved in synapse development and function, especially during infancy and early childhood, and differentially expressed in the post mortem ASD brain. Both gene sets are also regulatory targets of the ASD genes CHD8 and FMRP. It remains to be seen whether these represent two independent paths to the ASD phenotype or two components of a common path.           
26554012	A 3' untranslated region variant in FMR1 eliminates neuronal activity-dependent translation of FMRP by disrupting binding of the RNA-binding protein HuR.         FMR1, FMRP, HuR, autism, fragile X syndrome Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. The gene underlying the disorder, fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1), is silenced in most cases by a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Recently, we identified a variant located in the 3'UTR of FMR1 enriched among developmentally delayed males with normal repeat lengths. A patient-derived cell line revealed reduced levels of endogenous fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and a reporter containing a patient 3'UTR caused a decrease in expression. A control reporter expressed in cultured mouse cortical neurons showed an expected increase following synaptic stimulation that was absent when expressing the patient reporter, suggesting an impaired response to neuronal activity. Mobility-shift assays using a control RNA detected an RNA-protein interaction that is lost with the patient RNA, and HuR was subsequently identified as an associated protein. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation experiments identified the locus as an in vivo target of HuR, supporting our in vitro findings. These data suggest that the disrupted interaction of HuR impairs activity-dependent translation of FMRP, which may hinder synaptic plasticity in a clinically significant fashion.         
26558778	Convergence of Hippocampal Pathophysiology in Syngap+/- and Fmr1-/y Mice.         STED, SynGAP, fragile X syndrome, long-term depression, mGluR, neurodevelopmental disorder Previous studies have hypothesized that diverse genetic causes of intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) converge on common cellular pathways. Testing this hypothesis requires detailed phenotypic analyses of animal models with genetic mutations that accurately reflect those seen in the human condition (i.e., have structural validity) and which produce phenotypes that mirror ID/ASDs (i.e., have face validity). We show that SynGAP haploinsufficiency, which causes ID with co-occurring ASD in humans, mimics and occludes the synaptic pathophysiology associated with deletion of the Fmr1 gene. Syngap(+/-) and Fmr1(-/y) mice show increases in basal protein synthesis and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression that, unlike in their wild-type controls, is independent of new protein synthesis. Basal levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 are also elevated in Syngap(+/-) hippocampal slices. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that Syngap(+/-) and Fmr1(-/y) mice show nanoscale alterations in dendritic spine morphology that predict an increase in biochemical compartmentalization. Finally, increased basal protein synthesis is rescued by negative regulators of the mGlu subtype 5 receptor and the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway, indicating that therapeutic interventions for fragile X syndrome may benefit patients with SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency.          
26559723	Hippocampal dysregulation of FMRP/mGluR5 signaling in engrailed-2 knockout mice: a model of autism spectrum disorders.          Many evidences indicate that mice lacking the homeobox transcription factor engrailed-2 (En2(-/-) mice) represent a reliable model to investigate neurodevelopmental basis and gene expression changes relevant to autism spectrum disorders. Dysfunctions in fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), and GABAergic signaling pathways have been proposed as a possible pathogenic mechanism of autism spectrum disorders. Here, we exploited En2(-/-) mice to investigate hippocampal expression of FMRP, mGluR5, and GABA(A) receptor β3 subunit (GABRB3). Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR showed that all these mRNAs were significantly downregulated in En2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type littermates. Western blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed the downregulation of FMRP and GABRB3 proteins, while showing a significant increase of mGluR5 protein in the En2(-/-) hippocampus. Our results suggest that the dysregulation of FMRP-mGluR5 signaling pathway, accompanied with a downregulation of GABRB3 expression, may contribute to the 'autistic-like' features observed in En2 mice, providing possible molecular targets for future pharmacological studies.        
21068064	dFMRP and Caprin, translational regulators of synaptic plasticity, control the cell cycle at the Drosophila mid-blastula transition.          The molecular mechanisms driving the conserved metazoan developmental shift referred to as the mid-blastula transition (MBT) remain mysterious. Typically, cleavage divisions give way to longer asynchronous cell cycles with the acquisition of a gap phase. In Drosophila, rapid synchronous nuclear divisions must pause at the MBT to allow the formation of a cellular blastoderm through a special form of cytokinesis termed cellularization. Drosophila Fragile X mental retardation protein (dFMRP; FMR1), a transcript-specific translational regulator, is required for cellularization. The role of FMRP has been most extensively studied in the nervous system because the loss of FMRP activity in neurons causes the misexpression of specific mRNAs required for synaptic plasticity, resulting in mental retardation and autism in humans. Here, we show that in the early embryo dFMRP associates specifically with Caprin, another transcript-specific translational regulator implicated in synaptic plasticity, and with eIF4G, a key regulator of translational initiation. dFMRP and Caprin collaborate to control the cell cycle at the MBT by directly mediating the normal repression of maternal Cyclin B mRNA and the activation of zygotic frühstart mRNA. These findings identify two new targets of dFMRP regulation and implicate conserved translational regulatory mechanisms in processes as diverse as learning, memory and early embryonic development.        
26850918	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 deletion rescues auditory evoked potential habituation deficit in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.         Auditory cortex, Autism, Cortical event related potentials, Fragile X Syndrome, Matrix metalloproteinase-9, Sensory hypersensitivity Sensory processing deficits are common in autism spectrum disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Electrophysiological responses in humans with FXS show reduced habituation with sound repetition and this deficit may underlie auditory hypersensitivity in FXS. Our previous study in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice revealed an unusually long state of increased sound-driven excitability in auditory cortical neurons suggesting that cortical responses to repeated sounds may exhibit abnormal habituation as in humans with FXS. Here, we tested this prediction by comparing cortical event related potentials (ERP) recorded from wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice. We report a repetition-rate dependent reduction in habituation of N1 amplitude in Fmr1 KO mice and show that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), one of the known FMRP targets, contributes to the reduced ERP habituation. Our studies demonstrate a significant up-regulation of MMP-9 levels in the auditory cortex of adult Fmr1 KO mice, whereas a genetic deletion of Mmp-9 reverses ERP habituation deficits in Fmr1 KO mice. Although the N1 amplitude of Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO recordings was larger than WT and KO recordings, the habituation of ERPs in Mmp-9/Fmr1 DKO mice is similar to WT mice implicating MMP-9 as a potential target for reversing sensory processing deficits in FXS. Together these data establish ERP habituation as a translation relevant, physiological pre-clinical marker of auditory processing deficits in FXS and suggest that abnormal MMP-9 regulation is a mechanism underlying auditory hypersensitivity in FXS.          
29325626	Fragile X syndrome and fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome.         FMR1, FXPOI, FXS, FXTAS, fragile X syndrome, fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome Fragile X-associated disorders encompass several conditions, which are caused by expansion mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited etiology of intellectual disability and results from a full mutation or >200 CGG repeats in FMR1. It is associated with developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs in premutation carriers of 55-200 CGG repeats in FMR1 and is characterized by kinetic tremor, gait ataxia, parkinsonism, executive dysfunction, and neuropathy. Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency also occurs in premutation carrier women and manifests with infertility and early menopause. The diseases constituting fragile X-associated disorders differ mechanistically, due to the distinct molecular properties of premutation versus full mutations. Fragile X syndrome occurs when there is a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) due to FMR1 methylation and silencing. In fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome, a toxic gain of function is postulated with the production of excess CGG repeat-containing FMR1 mRNA, abnormal translation of the repeat sequence leading to production of polyglycine, polyalanine, and other polypeptides and to outright deficits in translation leading to reduced FMRP at larger premutation sizes. The changes in underlying brain chemistry due to FMR1 mutations have led to therapeutic studies in these disorders, with some progress being made in fragile X syndrome. This paper also summarizes indications for testing, genetic counseling issues, and what the future holds for these disorders.          
25432637	GABA receptor subunit distribution and FMRP-mGluR5 signaling abnormalities in the cerebellum of subjects with schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism.         Bipolar disorder, Cerebellum, FMRP, GABA, Schizophrenia, mGluR5 Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. GABAergic receptor abnormalities have been documented in several major psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism. Abnormal expression of mRNA and protein for multiple GABA receptors has also been observed in multiple brain regions leading to alterations in the balance between excitatory/inhibitory signaling in the brain with potential profound consequences for normal cognition and maintenance of mood and perception. Altered expression of GABAA receptor subunits has been documented in fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) knockout mice, suggesting that loss of its protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), impacts GABAA subunit expression. Recent postmortem studies from our laboratory have shown reduced expression of FMRP in the brains of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and autism. FMRP acts as a translational repressor and, under normal conditions, inhibits metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated signaling. In fragile X syndrome (FXS), the absence of FMRP is hypothesized to lead to unregulated mGluR5 signaling, ultimately resulting in the behavioral and intellectual impairments associated with this disorder. Our laboratory has identified changes in mGluR5 expression in autism, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. In the current review article, we discuss our postmortem data on GABA receptors, FMRP, and mGluR5 levels and compare our results with other laboratories. Finally, we discuss the interactions between these molecules and the potential for new therapeutic interventions that target these interconnected signaling systems.           
19193898	The FXG: a presynaptic fragile X granule expressed in a subset of developing brain circuits.          The loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited mental retardation and single gene cause of autism. Although postsynaptic functions for FMRP are well established, potential roles at the presynaptic apparatus remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the expression of FMRP and its homologs, FXR1P and FXR2P, in the developing, mature and regenerating rodent nervous system, with a focus on presynaptic expression. As expected, FMRP is expressed in the somatodendritic domain in virtually all neurons. However, FMRP is also localized in discrete granules (Fragile X granules; FXGs) in a subset of brain regions including frontal cortex, hippocampal area CA3 and olfactory bulb glomeruli. Immunoelectron microscopy shows that FMRP is localized at presynaptic terminals and in axons within these FXG-rich regions. With the exception of the olfactory bulb, FXGs are prominent only in the developing brain. Experiments in regenerating olfactory circuits indicate that peak FXG expression occurs 2-4 weeks after neurogenesis, a period that correlates with synapse formation and refinement. Virtually all FXGs contain FXR2P, while region-selective subsets harbor FMRP and/or FXR1P. Genetic studies show that FXR2P is essential for FXG expression, while FMRP regulates FXG number and developmental profile. These findings suggest that Fragile X proteins play a distinct, presynaptic role during discrete developmental epochs in defined circuits of the mammalian CNS. We propose that the neurological defects in Fragile X syndrome, including the autistic features, could be due in part to the loss of FMRP function in presynaptic compartments.        
19211207	Fragile X carrier screening and FMR1 allele distribution in the Japanese population.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is the most common form of familial mental retardation, is caused by the expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Previous studies have suggested that as compared to other populations, Japanese have a lower prevalence of FXS. In addition, in the normal population, there are no carriers who have the premutation allele. We analyzed a total of 946 normal Japanese (576 males and 370 females) and attempted to estimate the frequency of the FMR1 allele. Within this population, we found that 1,155 alleles were in the normal range (less than 40 CGG repeats) and had a modal number of 27 repeats (35.75%). No carriers with premutations (55-200 CGG repeats) were observed in this normal population. We also identified six intermediate-sized alleles (40-54 CGG repeats), with a reported incidence of 1 in 103 males and 1 in 324 females. However, this allele frequency was different from that previously reported for the Japanese population. Since data from previous studies has suggested that FXS might possibly be associated with the genetic mechanism of autism, we also analyzed the length of the CGG repeats in 109 autistic patients. In all cases the CGG repeat numbers were within the normal range (16-36 repeats) and no individuals presented with expanded premutation or intermediate alleles. This finding indicates that the length of the CGG repeat within the FMR1 is unlikely to be responsible for autism in Japanese.          
27695335	Expanded         DMPK repeats in dizygotic twins referred for diagnosis of autism versus absence of expanded DMPK repeats at screening of 330 children with autism. DMPK gene, autism, comorbidity, genetic testing, myotonic dystrophy type 1 Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) belongs to the broad spectrum of genetic disorders associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD were reported predominantly in congenital and early childhood forms of DM1. We describe dizygotic twin boys with ASD who were referred for routine laboratory genetic testing and in whom karyotyping,         FMR1 gene testing, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis yielded negative results. The father of the boys was later diagnosed with suspected DM1, and testing revealed characteristic DMPK gene expansions in his genome as well as in the genomes of both twins and their elder brother, who also suffered from ASD. In accord with previous reports on childhood forms of DM1, our patients showed prominent neuropsychiatric phenotypes characterized especially by hypotonia, developmental and language delay, emotional and affective lability, lowered adaptability, and social withdrawal. The experience with this family and multiple literature reports of ASD in DM1 on the one side but the lack of literature data on the frequency of DMPK gene expansions in ASD patients on the other side prompted us to screen the DMPK gene in a sample of 330 patients with ASD who were first seen by a geneticist before they were 10 years of age, before the muscular weakness, which may signal DM1, usually becomes obvious. The absence of any DMPK gene expansions in this cohort indicates that targeted DMPK gene testing can be recommended only in ASD patients with specific symptoms or family history suggestive of DM1.
27696642	Partially methylated alleles, microdeletion, and tissue mosaicism in a fragile X male with tremor and ataxia at 30 years of age: A case report.         Fragile X syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, fragile X related tremor/ataxia syndrome, mental retardation, methylation, molecular biology, mosaicism, tremor CGG repeat expansion >200 within FMR1, termed full mutation (FM), has been associated with promoter methylation, consequent silencing of gene expression and fragile X syndrome (FXS)-a common cause of intellectual disability and co-morbid autism. Unmethylated premutation (55-199 repeats) and FM alleles have been associated with fragile X related tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder. Here we present a 33-year-old male with FXS, with white matter changes and progressive deterioration in gait with cerebellar signs consistent with probable FXTAS; there was no evidence of any other cerebellar pathology. We show that he has tissue mosaicism in blood, saliva, and buccal samples for the size and methylation of his expanded alleles and a de novo, unmethylated microdeletion. This microdeletion involves a ∼80 bp sequence in the FMR1 promoter as well as complete loss of the CGG repeat in a proportion of cells. Despite FMR1 mRNA levels in blood within the normal range, the methylation and CGG sizing results are consistent with the diagnosis of concurrent FXS and probable FXTAS. The demonstrated presence of unmethylated FM alleles would explain the manifestation of milder than expected cognitive and behavioral impairments and early onset of cerebellar ataxia. Our case suggests that individuals with FXS, who manifest symptoms of FXTAS, may benefit from more detailed laboratory testing. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.          
27713816	CGG-repeat dynamics and         FMR1 gene silencing in fragile X syndrome stem cells and stem cell-derived neurons. Fragile X syndrome, Repeat contractions, Repeat expansion mutation, Repeat-mediated gene silencing, Stem cells Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common cause of intellectual disability and autism, results from the expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' untranslated region of the           FMR1 gene to >200 repeats. Such expanded alleles, known as full mutation (FM) alleles, are epigenetically silenced in differentiated cells thus resulting in the loss of FMRP, a protein important for learning and memory. The timing of repeat expansion and FMR1 gene silencing is controversial.
17562585	Fragile X syndrome: assessment and treatment implications.          Fragile X syndrome (FraX) is the most common known cause of inherited mental impairment. FMR1 gene mutations, the cause of FraX, lead to reduced expression of FMR1 protein and an increased risk for a particular profile of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunction. The study of individuals with FraX provides a unique window of understanding into important disorders such as autism, social phobia, cognitive disability, and depression. This review highlights the typical phenotypic features of individuals with FraX, discussing the apparent strengths and weaknesses in intellectual functioning, as evidenced from longitudinal follow-up studies. It also discusses recent neuroanatomic findings that may pave the way for more focused disease-specific pharmacologic and behavioral interventions. This article describes the results of recent medication trials designed to target symptoms associated with FraX. It also describes some recent behavioral interventions that were conducted in our laboratory.        
17592139	Inhibition of p21-activated kinase rescues symptoms of fragile X syndrome in mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most commonly inherited form of mental retardation and autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and consequent loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein. Despite growing evidence suggesting a role of specific receptors and biochemical pathways in FXS pathogenesis, an effective therapeutic method has not been developed. Here, we report that abnormalities in FMR1 knockout (KO) mice, an animal model of FXS, are ameliorated, at least partially, at both cellular and behavioral levels, by an inhibition of the catalytic activity of p21-activated kinase (PAK), a kinase known to play a critical role in actin polymerization and dendritic spine morphogenesis. Greater spine density and elongated spines in the cortex, morphological synaptic abnormalities commonly observed in FXS, are at least partially restored by postnatal expression of a dominant negative (dn) PAK transgene in the forebrain. Likewise, the deficit in cortical long-term potentiation observed in FMR1 KO mice is fully restored by the dnPAK transgene. Several behavioral abnormalities associated with FMR1 KO mice, including those in locomotor activity, stereotypy, anxiety, and trace fear conditioning are also ameliorated, partially or fully, by the dnPAK transgene. Finally, we demonstrate a direct interaction between PAK and fragile X mental retardation protein in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate the genetic rescue of phenotypes in a FXS mouse model and suggest that the PAK signaling pathway, including the catalytic activity of PAK, is a novel intervention site for development of an FXS and autism therapy.        
23464607	An investigation of narrative ability in boys with autism and fragile X syndrome.          Whereas pragmatic language difficulties are characteristic of both autism and Fragile X syndrome, it is unclear whether such deficits are qualitatively similar or whether certain skills are differentially affected. This study compared narrative competence in boys with autism, Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and typical development. Results revealed that an interaction between diagnosis and nonverbal mental age predicted narrative microstructure (e.g., complex syntax) but not macrostructure (e.g., thematic maintenance). Correlations with FMR1-related variation were investigated in children with Fragile X syndrome. While CGG repeat length was associated with many language characteristics, nonverbal IQ appeared to mediate these relationships. These findings are an important step toward understanding narrative abilities in boys with and without the FMR1 mutation.        
15362161	"Plasticity of nonneuronal brain tissue: roles in developmental disorders.          Neuronal and nonneuronal plasticity are both affected by environmental and experiential factors. Remodeling of existing neurons induced by such factors has been observed throughout the brain, and includes alterations in dendritic field dimensions, synaptogenesis, and synaptic morphology. The brain loci affected by these plastic neuronal changes are dependent on the type of experience and learning. Increased neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is a well-documented response to environmental complexity (""enrichment"") and learning. Exposure to challenging experiences and learning opportunities also alters existing glial cells (i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), and up-regulates gliogenesis, in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Such glial plasticity often parallels neuronal remodeling in both time and place, and this enhanced morphological synergism may be important for optimizing the functional interaction between glial cells and neurons. Aberrant structural plasticity of nonneuronal elements is a contributing factor, as is aberrant neuron plasticity, to neurological and developmental disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and mental retardation (i.e., fragile X syndrome). Some of these nonneuronal pathologies include abnormal cerebral and cerebellar white matter and myelin-related proteins in autism; abnormal myelin basic protein in fragile X syndrome (FXS); and abnormal astrocytes in autism, FXS, and epilepsy. A number of recent studies demonstrate the possibility of using environmental and experiential intervention to reduce or ameliorate some of the neuronal and nonneuronal abnormalities, as well as behavioral deficits, present in these neurological and developmental disorders.

26516618	Persistent astrocyte activation in the fragile X mouse cerebellum.         Astrogliosis, FMRP, GFAP, LIF, S100B, TNFR2, autism, myelin, oligodendrocyte precursor cells Fragile X Syndrome, the most common single gene cause of autism, results from loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Although FMRP is highly expressed in neurons, it has also recently been identified in glia. It has been postulated that in the absence of FMRP, abnormal function of non-neuronal cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disorder. We previously demonstrated reduced numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and delayed myelination in the cerebellum of fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mice.          
12655491	Self-injurious behavior in young boys with fragile X syndrome.          In this study, we distributed surveys to 67 families of young boys with fragile X syndrome to determine the prevalence, onset, form, function, location, and correlates of self-injurious behavior. Fifty-five surveys were completed (82%). The mean age of the boys at the time of the survey was 80 months (range = 20-144). Self-injurious behavior (SIB) was reported for 58% of the participants with a mean age of onset of 31 months. The mean number of forms of self-injury was 2 per participant. Biting was the most commonly reported form of self-injury with the fingers and back of the hand disproportionately targeted as the most prevalent self-injury body site. There was no linear increase in risk of SIB with age past 25 months. SIB was reported as most likely to occur following the presentation of difficult task demands or changes in routine. Significant group differences were found between overall ratings of problem behavior for boys with self-injury compared to those without self-injury. Groups did not differ on measures of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), autism status, adaptive behavior, or age first medicated. Results are discussed in terms of future research designed to further elucidate the behavioral phenotype of fragile X syndrome.          
7977358	Molecular analysis and test of linkage between the FMR-1 gene and infantile autism in multiplex families.          Approximately 2%-5% of autistic children show cytogenetic evidence of the fragile X syndrome. This report tests whether infantile autism in multiplex autism families arises from an unusual manifestion of the fragile X syndrome. This could arise either by expansion of the (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat in FMR-1 or from a mutation elsewhere in the gene. We studied 35 families that met stringent criteria for multiplex autism. Amplification of the trinucleotide repeat and analysis of methylation status were performed in 79 autistic children and in 31 of their unaffected siblings, by Southern blot analysis. No examples of amplified repeats were seen in the autistic or control children or in their parents or grandparents. We next examined the hypothesis that there was a mutation elsewhere in the FMR-1 gene, by linkage analysis in 32 of these families. We tested four different dominant models and a recessive model. Linkage to FMR-1 could be excluded (lod score between -24 and -62) in all models by using probes DXS548, FRAXAC1, and FRAXAC2 and the CGG repeat itself. Tests for heterogeneity in this sample were negative, and the occurrence of positive lod scores in this data set could be attributed to chance. Analysis of the data by the affected-sib method also did not show evidence for linkage of any marker to autism. These results enable us to reject the hypothesis that multiplex autism arises from expansion of the (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat in FMR-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)        
30385191	Increased severity of fragile X spectrum disorders in the agricultural community of Ricaurte, Colombia.         Colombia, FXPOI, FXTAS, Fragile X spectrum disorders, Fragile X syndrome Premutation carriers of the FMR1 gene (CGG repeats between 55 and 200) usually have normal intellectual abilities but approximately 20% are diagnosed with developmental problems or autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, close to 50% have psychiatric problems such as anxiety, ADHD and/or depression. The spectrum of fragile X disorders also includes Fragile-X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in female carriers and Fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) in older male and female carriers. We evaluated 25 premutation carriers in the rural community of Ricaurte Colombia and documented all behavioral problems, social deficits and clinical signs of FXPOI and FXTAS as well as reviewed the medical and obstetric history. We found an increased frequency and severity of symptoms of fragile X spectrum disorders, which might be related to the vulnerability of FMR1 premutation carriers to higher exposure to neurotoxic pesticides in this rural community.          
19325170	The state of synapses in fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation and a leading genetic cause of autism. There is increasing evidence in both FXS and other forms of autism that alterations in synapse number, structure, and function are associated and contribute to these prevalent diseases. FXS is caused by loss of function of the Fmr1 gene, which encodes the RNA binding protein, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Therefore, FXS is a tractable model to understand synaptic dysfunction in cognitive disorders. FMRP is present at synapses where it associates with mRNA and polyribosomes. Accumulating evidence finds roles for FMRP in synapse development, elimination, and plasticity. Here, the authors review the synaptic changes observed in FXS and try to relate these changes to what is known about the molecular function of FMRP. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular and synaptic function of FMRP, as well as the consequences of its loss, have led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for FXS.        
26022075	Putative Microcircuit-Level Substrates for Attention Are Disrupted in Mouse Models of Autism.         Acetylcholine, Calcium imaging, Fragile X syndrome, GCaMP, Prefrontal cortex, Valproic acid Deep layer excitatory circuits in the prefrontal cortex represent the strongest locus for genetic convergence in autism, but specific abnormalities within these circuits that mediate key features of autism, such as cognitive or attentional deficits, remain unknown. Attention normally increases the sensitivity of neural populations to incoming signals by decorrelating ongoing cortical circuit activity. Here, we investigated whether mechanisms underlying this phenomenon might be disrupted within deep layer prefrontal circuits in mouse models of autism.          
26026973	Deciphering discord: How Drosophila research has enhanced our understanding of the importance of FMRP in different spatial and temporal contexts.         Circadian behavior, Drosophila, Fragile X, Memory, Neurogenesis Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of intellectual impairment as well as the leading monogenetic cause of autism. In addition to its canonical definition as a neurodevelopmental disease, recent findings in the clinic suggest that FXS is a systemic disorder that is characterized by a variety of heterogeneous phenotypes. Efforts to study FXS pathogenesis have been aided by the development and characterization of animal models of the disease. Research efforts in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed key insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of FXS. While much remains unknown, it is increasingly apparent that FXS involves a myriad of spatially and temporally specific alterations in cellular function. Consequently, the literature is filled with numerous discordant findings. Researchers and clinicians alike must be cognizant of this dissonance, as it will likely be important for the design of preclinical studies to assess the efficacy of therapeutic strategies to improve the lives of FXS patients.           
19996900	Broad clinical involvement in a family affected by the fragile X premutation.          The mutations in the FMR1 gene have been described as a family of disorders called fragile X-associated disorders including fragile X syndrome, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, and other problems associated with the premutation, such as hypothyroidism, hypertension, neuropathy, anxiety, depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, and autism spectrum disorders. The premutation is relatively common in the general population affecting 1 of 130 to 250 female individuals and 1 of 250 to 800 male individuals. Therefore, to provide appropriate treatment and genetic counseling for all of the carriers and affected individuals in a family, a detailed family history that reviews many of the disorders that are related to both the premutation and the full mutation should be carried out as exemplified in these cases. To facilitate the integration of this knowledge into clinical practice, this is the first case report that demonstrates only premutation involvement across 3 generations.        
25271084	MBD5 haploinsufficiency is associated with sleep disturbance and disrupts circadian pathways common to Smith-Magenis and fragile X syndromes.          Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who have an identifiable single-gene neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), such as fragile X syndrome (FXS, FMR1), Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS, RAI1), or 2q23.1 deletion syndrome (del 2q23.1, MBD5) share phenotypic features, including a high prevalence of sleep disturbance. We describe the circadian deficits in del 2q23.1 through caregiver surveys in which we identify several frequent sleep anomalies, including night/early awakenings, coughing/snoring loudly, and difficulty falling asleep. We couple these findings with studies on the molecular analysis of the circadian deficits associated with haploinsufficiency of MBD5 in which circadian gene mRNA levels of NR1D2, PER1, PER2, and PER3 were altered in del 2q23.1 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), signifying that haploinsufficiency of MBD5 can result in dysregulation of circadian rhythm gene expression. These findings were further supported by expression microarrays of MBD5 siRNA knockdown cells that showed significantly altered expression of additional circadian rhythm signaling pathway genes. Based on the common sleep phenotypes observed in del 2q23.1, SMS, and FXS patients, we explored the possibility that MBD5, RAI1, and FMR1 function in overlapping circadian rhythm pathways. Bioinformatic analysis identified conserved putative E boxes in MBD5 and RAI1, and expression levels of NR1D2 and CRY2 were significantly reduced in patient LCLs. Circadian and mTOR signaling pathways, both associated with sleep disturbance, were altered in both MBD5 and RAI1 knockdown microarray data, overlapping with findings associated with FMR1. These data support phenotypic and molecular overlaps across these syndromes that may be exploited to provide therapeutic intervention for multiple disorders.         
25278957	Clinical and molecular implications of mosaicism in FMR1 full mutations.         FMR1, FMRP, fragile X, methylation, mosaicism, premutation Expansions of more than 200 CGG repeats (full mutation) in the FMR1 gene give rise to fragile X syndrome (FXS) through a process that generally involves hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter region and gene silencing, resulting in absence of expression of the encoded protein, FMRP. However, mosaicism with alleles differing in size and extent of methylation often exist within or between tissues of individuals with FXS. In the current work, CGG-repeat lengths and methylation status were assessed for eighteen individuals with FXS, including 13 mosaics, for which peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) and primary fibroblast cells were available. Our results show that for both PBMCs and fibroblasts, FMR1 mRNA and FMRP expression are directly correlated with the percent of methylation of the FMR1 allele. In addition, Full Scale IQ scores were inversely correlated with the percent methylation and positively correlated with higher FMRP expression. These latter results point toward a positive impact on cognition for full mutation mosaics with lower methylation compared to individuals with fully methylated, full mutation alleles. However, we did not observe a significant reduction in the number of seizures, nor in the severity of hyperactivity or autism spectrum disorder, among individuals with mosaic genotypes in the presentation of FXS. These observations suggest that low, but non-zero expression of FMRP may be sufficient to positively impact cognitive function in individuals with FXS, with methylation mosaicism (lowered methylation fraction) contributing to a more positive clinical outcome.         
25284784	De novo insertions and deletions of predominantly paternal origin are associated with autism spectrum disorder.          Whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies have demonstrated the contribution of de novo loss-of-function single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, challenges in the reliable detection of de novo insertions and deletions (indels) have limited inclusion of these variants in prior analyses. By applying a robust indel detection method to WES data from 787 ASD families (2,963 individuals), we demonstrate that de novo frameshift indels contribute to ASD risk (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0-2.7; p = 0.03), are more common in female probands (p = 0.02), are enriched among genes encoding FMRP targets (p = 6 × 10(-9)), and arise predominantly on the paternal chromosome (p < 0.001). On the basis of mutation rates in probands versus unaffected siblings, we conclude that de novo frameshift indels contribute to risk in approximately 3% of individuals with ASD. Finally, by observing clustering of mutations in unrelated probands, we uncover two ASD-associated genes: KMT2E (MLL5), a chromatin regulator, and RIMS1, a regulator of synaptic vesicle release.          
28012946	Impaired GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout mice.         Fmr1 knockout mice, Fragile X syndrome, GABA(A) receptor subunit, Hippocampus, Inhibitory postsynaptic current Many clinical and molecular features of the fragile X syndrome, a common form of intellectual disability and autism, can be modeled by deletion of the Fmr1 protein (Fmrp) in mice. Previous studies showed a decreased expression of several components of the GABAergic system in Fmr1 knockout mice. Here, we used this mouse model to investigate the functional consequences of Fmrp deletion on hippocampal GABAergic inhibition in the CA1-region of the hippocampus. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated a significantly reduced amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous IPSCs. In addition, miniature IPSCs were reduced in amplitude and frequency and decayed significantly slower than mIPSCs in controls. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a significantly lower expression of α2, β1 and δ GABA          A receptor subunits in the hippocampus of the juvenile mice (P22) compared to wild-type littermates. Correspondingly, we found also at the protein level reduced amounts of α2, β1 and δ subunits in Fmr1 knockout mice. Overall, these results demonstrate that the reduction in several components of the GABAergic system is already present at young age and that this reduction results in measurable abnormalities on GABAA receptor-mediated phasic inhibition. These abnormalities might contribute to the behavioral and cognitive deficits of this fragile X mouse model.
29844802	Assessment of efficacy of prenatal genetic diagnosis for fragile X syndrome using nested PCR.         CGG repeat, FMR1, fragile X syndrome, nested polymerase chain reaction Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. It has previously been demonstrated that prenatal genetic diagnosis is efficient for the diagnosis of FXS. The present study investigated the diagnostic effects of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) and expanded CGG repeats. It was demonstrated that the nested PCR assay rapidly measured the multi-copies of the         FMR1 gene in individual samples. The nested PCR assay detected normal CGG repeat lengths and expanded CGG repeat lengths with a low occurrence of false positives. In addition, the nested PCR assay resulted in increased sensitivity and specificity for patients with FXS. Furthermore, the nested PCR assay identified the mutation and generated conclusive cases for FXS, indicating that this assay is beneficial for the diagnosis of FXS patients. In conclusion, these outcomes indicate that nested PCR assay is a reliable and easier method for diagnosis of FXS, which may be used for the diagnosis of FXS patients.
20014373	Treatments for fragile X syndrome: a closer look at the data.          Research into the determinants and developmental course of fragile X syndrome (FXS) has made remarkable progress over the last 25 years. However, treatments to ameliorate the symptoms of FXS have been less forthcoming. While there is optimism in the field that the pace of intervention research is quickening, there has been a bias toward psychopharmacological approaches to treatment. A closer look at the data from those investigations reveals a paucity of evidence that medications can improve intellectual and adaptive functioning in FXS, or decrease associated behavioral and/or emotional issues. Work in other related disorders (e.g., autism) has shown that dramatic improvements in intellectual and adaptive functioning, as well as behavioral and emotional problems, can occur if intensive behavioral treatment is begun early in the child's life. It is hoped that future research efforts will evaluate these intensive early intervention strategies in children with FXS, perhaps in combination with pharmacological approaches.        
29036014	A family with two cases of melanocytic tumors and fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability, most commonly results from an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene to more than 200 copies (full mutation). The FXS phenotype differs by sex and is associated with intellectual and cognitive impairment, characteristic physical features, epilepsy, and/or behavioral challenges including autism spectrum disorder. In this patient population, tumors involving blood cells, digestive organs, the central nervous system, and testes have been described, but melanocytic tumors have not been reported. Here, we describe two maternal cousins with FXS, one of whom has melanoma and the other has atypical nevus syndrome. We discuss possible mechanisms leading to this unusual or possibly coincidental association and the difficulties in the optimal treatment of FXS patients.        
29038238	Delayed Maturation of Fast-Spiking Interneurons Is Rectified by Activation of the TrkB Receptor in the Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.         TrkB, critical period, fast-spiking interneuron, fragile X syndrome, somatosensory cortex, synapse Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability, and the most common known cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS is broadly characterized by sensory hypersensitivity and several developmental alterations in synaptic and circuit function have been uncovered in the sensory cortex of the mouse model of FXS (          Fmr1 KO). GABA-mediated neurotransmission and fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic interneurons are central to cortical circuit development in the neonate. Here we demonstrate that there is a delay in the maturation of the intrinsic properties of FS interneurons in the sensory cortex, and a deficit in the formation of excitatory synaptic inputs on to these neurons in neonatal Fmr1 KO mice. Both these delays in neuronal and synaptic maturation were rectified by chronic administration of a TrkB receptor agonist. These results demonstrate that the maturation of the GABAergic circuit in the sensory cortex is altered during a critical developmental period due in part to a perturbation in BDNF-TrkB signaling, and could contribute to the alterations in cortical development underlying the sensory pathophysiology of FXS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Fragile X (FXS) individuals have a range of sensory related phenotypes, and there is growing evidence of alterations in neuronal circuits in the sensory cortex of the mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 KO). GABAergic interneurons are central to the correct formation of circuits during cortical critical periods. Here we demonstrate a delay in the maturation of the properties and synaptic connectivity of interneurons in Fmr1 KO mice during a critical period of cortical development. The delays both in cellular and synaptic maturation were rectified by administration of a TrkB receptor agonist, suggesting reduced BDNF-TrkB signaling as a contributing factor. These results provide evidence that the function of fast-spiking interneurons is disrupted due to a deficiency in neurotrophin signaling during early development in FXS.
29040407	Genetic Reduction of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Promotes Formation of Perineuronal Nets Around Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneurons and Normalizes Auditory Cortex Responses in Developing Fmr1 Knock-Out Mice.          Abnormal sensory responses associated with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorders include hypersensitivity and impaired habituation to repeated stimuli. Similar sensory deficits are also observed in adult Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice and are reversed by genetic deletion of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) through yet unknown mechanisms. Here we present new evidence that impaired development of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons may underlie hyper-responsiveness in auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice via MMP-9-dependent regulation of perineuronal nets (PNNs). First, we found that PV cell development and PNN formation around GABAergic interneurons were impaired in developing auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Second, MMP-9 levels were elevated in P12-P18 auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice and genetic reduction of MMP-9 to WT levels restored the formation of PNNs around PV cells. Third, in vivo single-unit recordings from auditory cortex neurons showed enhanced spontaneous and sound-driven responses in developing Fmr1 KO mice, which were normalized following genetic reduction of MMP-9. These findings indicate that elevated MMP-9 levels contribute to the development of sensory hypersensitivity by influencing formation of PNNs around PV interneurons suggesting MMP-9 as a new therapeutic target to reduce sensory deficits in FXS and potentially other autism spectrum disorders.        
26733386	Monogenic mouse models of autism spectrum disorders: Common mechanisms and missing links.         Fmr1, Mecp2, Pten, Shank3, Ube3a, autism mouse models Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present unique challenges in the fields of genetics and neurobiology because of the clinical and molecular heterogeneity underlying these disorders. Genetic mutations found in ASD patients provide opportunities to dissect the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying autistic behaviors using animal models. Ongoing studies of genetically modified models have offered critical insight into possible common mechanisms arising from different mutations, but links between molecular abnormalities and behavioral phenotypes remain elusive. The challenges encountered in modeling autism in mice demand a new analytic paradigm that integrates behavioral assessment with circuit-level analysis in genetically modified models with strong construct validity.           
18093519	Correction of fragile X syndrome in mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of heritable mental retardation and the leading identified cause of autism. FXS is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene that encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), but the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. According to one proposal, many psychiatric and neurological symptoms of FXS result from unchecked activation of mGluR5, a metabotropic glutamate receptor. To test this idea we generated Fmr1 mutant mice with a 50% reduction in mGluR5 expression and studied a range of phenotypes with relevance to the human disorder. Our results demonstrate that mGluR5 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease, a finding that has significant therapeutic implications for fragile X and related developmental disorders.        
19514725	"Polymerase chain reaction, nuclease digestion, and mass spectrometry based assay for the trinucleotide repeat status of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene.          CGG repeat expansions in the 5' noncoding region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) give rise to both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative human diseases depending on the length of the expansion. Expansions beyond 200 repeats (full mutation) generally result in gene silencing and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable form of cognitive impairment and autism. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; ""premutation"") give rise to the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) through an entirely distinct, toxic mRNA gain-of-function mechanism. A rapid means for both high-risk and newborn screening for allele size would provide a greater opportunity for early intervention and family counseling as well as furnish critical data on repeat size distribution and expanded allele frequencies. In the current work, we propose a novel mass spectrometry (MS) based method for the rapid identification of expanded CGG repeats to complement a recently described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for large population screening. In this combined approach, the optimized PCR method is used to amplify the relevant region of FMR1, followed by extensive nonspecific nuclease digestion. The resulting oligonucleotides are analyzed by MS in a manner that provides the relative proportion of triplet repeat oligonucleotides in seconds per sample. This assay enables swift and reproducible detection of expanded CGG alleles using a single blood spot and in principle is suitable for large scale studies and newborn screening. Moreover, this analytical scheme establishes a unique new intersection of MS with molecular biology, with potential for significant interdisciplinary impact.        "
20425835	FMR1 gene expansion, large deletion of Xp, and skewed X-inactivation in a girl with mental retardation and autism.          We describe a girl with mild facial anomalies, mild mental retardation, and atypical autism with a remarkable behavioral phenotype of persistent anger, aggression, and dysphoria. The occurrence of late-onset tremor and premature ovarian failure in the maternal branch of the family pointed to a possible defect in the FMR1 gene. Indeed, the patient carried a full FMR1 mutation. Unexpectedly, both alleles of the gene were almost completely methylated. Cytogenetic examination of the patient revealed in addition a large de novo deletion in band Xp22 on one of her X chromosomes. The deletion was fine mapped using oligonucleotide array CGH, and its breakpoints were localized using sequencing. The size of the deletion was about 17.4 Mb, and it contained more than 90 protein-coding genes. Microsatellite analysis indicated paternal origin of the aberrant chromosome. The large rearrangement was the most probable cause of the X-inactivation skewing, thus explaining the methylation of not only the expanded (maternal) but also the normal (paternal) FMR1 alleles. This pattern of skewed X-inactivation was confirmed using the analysis of methylation at the AR locus. The relatively mild phenotype of the patient resulted most likely from unmasking of the FMR1 defect. Although the deleted region contained many important genes, the phenotypic contribution of the rearranged X chromosome was probably limited by its almost complete inactivation. However, reduced dose of several genes escaping X-inactivation might also play a role in the phenotype of the patient.        
20434996	Fragile X mental retardation protein is required for synapse elimination by the activity-dependent transcription factor MEF2.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic form of mental retardation and autism, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in an RNA-binding protein, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Neurons from patients and the mouse Fmr1 knockout (KO) model are characterized by an excess of dendritic spines, suggesting a deficit in excitatory synapse elimination. In response to neuronal activity, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors induce robust synapse elimination. Here, we demonstrate that MEF2 activation fails to eliminate functional or structural excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons from Fmr1 KO mice. Similarly, inhibition of endogenous MEF2 increases synapse number in wild-type but not Fmr1 KO neurons. MEF2-dependent synapse elimination is rescued in Fmr1 KO neurons by acute postsynaptic expression of wild-type but not RNA-binding mutants of FMRP. Our results reveal that active MEF2 and FMRP function together in an acute, cell-autonomous mechanism to eliminate excitatory synapses.          
20439717	"Region-specific alterations in brain development in one- to three-year-old boys with fragile X syndrome.          Longitudinal neuroimaging investigation of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism, provides an opportunity to study the influence of a specific genetic factor on neurodevelopment in the living human brain. We examined voxel-wise gray and white matter volumes (GMV, WMV) over a 2-year period in 1- to 3-year-old boys with FXS (n = 41) and compared these findings to age- and developmentally matched controls (n = 28). We found enlarged GMV in the caudate, thalamus, and fusiform gyri and reduced GMV in the cerebellar vermis in FXS at both timepoints, suggesting early, possibly prenatal, genetically mediated alterations in neurodevelopment. In contrast, regions in which initial GMV was similar, followed by an altered growth trajectory leading to increased size in FXS, such as the orbital gyri, basal forebrain, and thalamus, suggests delayed or otherwise disrupted synaptic pruning occurring postnatally. WMV of striatal-prefrontal regions was greater in FXS compared with controls, and group differences became more exaggerated over time, indicating the possibility that such WM abnormalities are the result of primary FMRP-deficiency-related axonal pathology, as opposed to secondary connectional dysregulation between morphologically atypical brain structures. Our results indicate that structural abnormalities of different brain regions in FXS evolve differently over time reflecting time-dependent effects of FMRP deficiency and provide insight into their neuropathologic underpinnings. The creation of an early and accurate human brain phenotype for FXS in humans will significantly improve our capability to detect whether new disease-specific treatments can ""rescue"" the FXS phenotype in affected individuals.        "
20442204	Fragile X mental retardation protein has a unique, evolutionarily conserved neuronal function not shared with FXR1P or FXR2P.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), resulting solely from the loss of function of the human fragile X mental retardation 1 (hFMR1) gene, is the most common heritable cause of mental retardation and autism disorders, with syndromic defects also in non-neuronal tissues. In addition, the human genome encodes two closely related hFMR1 paralogs: hFXR1 and hFXR2. The Drosophila genome, by contrast, encodes a single dFMR1 gene with close sequence homology to all three human genes. Drosophila that lack the dFMR1 gene (dfmr1 null mutants) recapitulate FXS-associated molecular, cellular and behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that FMR1 function has been conserved, albeit with specific functions possibly sub-served by the expanded human gene family. To test evolutionary conservation, we used tissue-targeted transgenic expression of all three human genes in the Drosophila disease model to investigate function at (1) molecular, (2) neuronal and (3) non-neuronal levels. In neurons, dfmr1 null mutants exhibit elevated protein levels that alter the central brain and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synaptic architecture, including an increase in synapse area, branching and bouton numbers. Importantly, hFMR1 can, comparably to dFMR1, fully rescue both the molecular and cellular defects in neurons, whereas hFXR1 and hFXR2 provide absolutely no rescue. For non-neuronal requirements, we assayed male fecundity and testes function. dfmr1 null mutants are effectively sterile owing to disruption of the 9+2 microtubule organization in the sperm tail. Importantly, all three human genes fully and equally rescue mutant fecundity and spermatogenesis defects. These results indicate that FMR1 gene function is evolutionarily conserved in neural mechanisms and cannot be compensated by either FXR1 or FXR2, but that all three proteins can substitute for each other in non-neuronal requirements. We conclude that FMR1 has a neural-specific function that is distinct from its paralogs, and that the unique FMR1 function is responsible for regulating neuronal protein expression and synaptic connectivity.        
24646437	Activity-dependent regulation of release probability at excitatory hippocampal synapses: a crucial role of fragile X mental retardation protein in neurotransmission.         excitatory postsynaptic current, fragile X syndrome, hippocampus, mouse, release probability, short-term plasticity Transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene encoding fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the leading genetic cause of autism. FMRP has been suggested to play important roles in regulating neurotransmission and short-term synaptic plasticity at excitatory hippocampal and cortical synapses. However, the origins and mechanisms of these FMRP actions remain incompletely understood, and the role of FMRP in regulating synaptic release probability and presynaptic function remains debated. Here we used variance-mean analysis and peak-scaled nonstationary variance analysis to examine changes in both presynaptic and postsynaptic parameters during repetitive activity at excitatory CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses in a mouse model of FXS. Our analyses revealed that loss of FMRP did not affect the basal release probability or basal synaptic transmission, but caused an abnormally elevated release probability specifically during repetitive activity. These abnormalities were not accompanied by changes in excitatory postsynaptic current kinetics, quantal size or postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor conductance. Our results thus indicate that FMRP regulates neurotransmission at excitatory hippocampal synapses specifically during repetitive activity via modulation of release probability in a presynaptic manner. Our study suggests that FMRP function in regulating neurotransmitter release is an activity-dependent phenomenon that may contribute to the pathophysiology of FXS.           
24648324	Concise review: Fragile X proteins in stem cell maintenance and differentiation.         Adult stem cells, Developmental biology, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, Nervous system, Neural differentiation, Neural stem cell, Pluripotent stem cells, Stem cell plasticity Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic form of autism spectrum disorder, is caused by deficiency of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Despite extensive research and scientific progress, understanding how FMRP regulates brain development and function remains a major challenge. FMRP is a neuronal RNA-binding protein that binds about a third of messenger RNAs in the brain and controls their translation, stability, and cellular localization. The absence of FMRP results in increased protein synthesis, leading to enhanced signaling in a number of intracellular pathways, including the mTOR, mGLuR5, ERK, Gsk3β, PI3K, and insulin pathways. Until recently, FXS was largely considered a deficit of mature neurons; however, a number of new studies have shown that FMRP may also play important roles in stem cells, among them neural stem cells, germline stem cells, and pluripotent stem cells. In this review, we will cover these newly discovered functions of FMRP, as well as the other two fragile X-related proteins, in stem cells. We will also discuss the literature on the use of stem cells, particularly neural stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, as model systems for studying the functions of FMRP in neuronal development.          
24654675	iPSC-derived forebrain neurons from FXS individuals show defects in initial neurite outgrowth.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and is closely linked with autism. The genetic basis of FXS is an expansion of CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome leading to the loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The cause of FXS has been known for over 20 years, yet the full molecular and cellular consequences of this mutation remain unclear. Although mouse and fly models have provided significant understanding of this disorder and its effects on the central nervous system, insight from human studies is limited. We have created human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from fibroblasts obtained from individuals with FXS to enable in vitro modeling of the human disease. Three young boys with FXS who came from a well-characterized cohort representative of the range of affectedness typical for the syndrome were recruited to aid in linking cellular and behavioral phenotypes. The FMR1 mutation is preserved during the reprogramming of patient fibroblasts to iPSCs. Mosaicism of the CGG repeat length in one of the patient's fibroblasts allowed for the generation of isogenic lines with differing CGG repeat lengths from the same patient. FXS forebrain neurons were differentiated from these iPSCs and display defective neurite initiation and extension. These cells provide a well-characterized resource to examine potential neuronal deficits caused by FXS as well as the function of FMRP in human neurons.         
25199916	Clustering autism: using neuroanatomical differences in 26 mouse models to gain insight into the heterogeneity.          Autism is a heritable disorder, with over 250 associated genes identified to date, yet no single gene accounts for >1-2% of cases. The clinical presentation, behavioural symptoms, imaging and histopathology findings are strikingly heterogeneous. A more complete understanding of autism can be obtained by examining multiple genetic or behavioural mouse models of autism using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based neuroanatomical phenotyping. Twenty-six different mouse models were examined and the consistently found abnormal brain regions across models were parieto-temporal lobe, cerebellar cortex, frontal lobe, hypothalamus and striatum. These models separated into three distinct clusters, two of which can be linked to the under and over-connectivity found in autism. These clusters also identified previously unknown connections between Nrxn1α, En2 and Fmr1; Nlgn3, BTBR and Slc6A4; and also between X monosomy and Mecp2. With no single treatment for autism found, clustering autism using neuroanatomy and identifying these strong connections may prove to be a crucial step in predicting treatment response.         
30250263	Impaired perceptual learning in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome is mediated by parvalbumin neuron dysfunction and is reversible.          To uncover the circuit-level alterations that underlie atypical sensory processing associated with autism, we adopted a symptom-to-circuit approach in the Fmr1-knockout (Fmr1        -/-) mouse model of Fragile X syndrome. Using a go/no-go task and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we find that impaired visual discrimination in Fmr1-/- mice correlates with marked deficits in orientation tuning of principal neurons and with a decrease in the activity of parvalbumin interneurons in primary visual cortex. Restoring visually evoked activity in parvalbumin cells in Fmr1-/- mice with a chemogenetic strategy using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs was sufficient to rescue their behavioral performance. Strikingly, human subjects with Fragile X syndrome exhibit impairments in visual discrimination similar to those in Fmr1-/- mice. These results suggest that manipulating inhibition may help sensory processing in Fragile X syndrome.
30262549	Prepulse inhibition in         Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Centaurin, Fragile X syndrome, Psychiatric disease, Startle response The neural mechanisms of psychiatric diseases like autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia have been intensively studied, and a number of candidate genes have been identified. However, the relationship between genes and neural system functioning remains unclear. Model organisms may serve as a powerful tool for addressing this question due to the availability of established genetic tools. Here, we report prepulse inhibition (PPI) in           Drosophila larvae for the first time. PPI is a neurological phenomenon found in humans and other organisms and is used in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. A weaker prestimulus (prepulse) inhibits the reaction to a subsequent strong, startling stimulus (pulse). Using the larval startle response to the buzz of a predator (wasp), we examined PPI in wild-type flies and two mutants: an fmr1 mutant, which is implicated in Fragile X syndrome, and a centaurin gamma 1A (CenG1A) mutant, which is associated with GTPase, PH, ArfGAP, and ANK domains and implicated in autism. Both mutants showed decreased PPI, whereas, interestingly, double mutants showed substantial PPI. The PPI phenomenon described here can provide a useful tool for the study of neural mechanisms of synaptic modification and psychiatric diseases.
24550778	Auditory processing in fragile x syndrome.         audiogenic seizures, auditory responses, autism, biomarkers, cortex, fragile X syndrome, sensory hypersensitivity Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of intellectual disability and autism. Among other symptoms, FXS patients demonstrate abnormalities in sensory processing and communication. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity in humans with FXS. Consistent with observations in humans, the Fmr1 KO mouse model of FXS also shows evidence of altered auditory processing and communication deficiencies. A well-known and commonly used phenotype in pre-clinical studies of FXS is audiogenic seizures. In addition, increased acoustic startle response is seen in the Fmr1 KO mice. In vivo electrophysiological recordings indicate hyper-excitable responses, broader frequency tuning, and abnormal spectrotemporal processing in primary auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, auditory hyper-excitability is a robust, reliable, and translatable biomarker in Fmr1 KO mice. Abnormal auditory evoked responses have been used as outcome measures to test therapeutics in FXS patients. Given that similarly abnormal responses are present in Fmr1 KO mice suggests that cellular mechanisms can be addressed. Sensory cortical deficits are relatively more tractable from a mechanistic perspective than more complex social behaviors that are typically studied in autism and FXS. The focus of this review is to bring together clinical, functional, and structural studies in humans with electrophysiological and behavioral studies in mice to make the case that auditory hypersensitivity provides a unique opportunity to integrate molecular, cellular, circuit level studies with behavioral outcomes in the search for therapeutics for FXS and other autism spectrum disorders.         
28688003	Increased Training Intensity Induces Proper Membrane Localization of Actin Remodeling Proteins in the Hippocampus Preventing Cognitive Deficits: Implications for Fragile X Syndrome.         FXS, Hippocampus, Intensive interventional therapy, Learning and memory, Rac1 Behavioral intervention therapy has proven beneficial in the treatment of autism and intellectual disabilities (ID), raising the possibility of certain changes in molecular mechanisms activated by these interventions that may promote learning. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autistic features and intellectual disability and can serve as a model to examine mechanisms that promote learning. FXS results from mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (Fmr1) that prevents expression of the Fmr1 protein (FMRP), a messenger RNA (mRNA) translation regulator at synapses. Among many other functions, FMRP organizes a complex with the actin cytoskeleton-regulating small Rho GTPase Rac1. As in humans, Fmr1 KO mice lacking FMRP display autistic-like behaviors and deformities of actin-rich synaptic structures in addition to impaired hippocampal learning and synaptic plasticity. These features have been previously linked to proper function of actin remodeling proteins that includes Rac1. An important step in Rac1 activation and function is its translocation to the membrane, where it can influence synaptic actin cytoskeleton remodeling during hippocampus-dependent learning. Herein, we report that Fmr1 KO mouse hippocampus exhibits increased levels of membrane-bound Rac1, which may prevent proper learning-induced synaptic changes. We also determine that increasing training intensity during fear conditioning (FC) training restores contextual memory in Fmr1 KO mice and reduces membrane-bound Rac1 in Fmr1 KO hippocampus. Increased training intensity also results in normalized long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices taken from Fmr1 KO mice. These results point to interventional treatments providing new therapeutic options for FXS-related cognitive dysfunction.        
30224722	Identification of a molecular locus for normalizing dysregulated GABA release from interneurons in the Fragile X brain.          Principal neurons encode information by varying their firing rate and patterns precisely fine-tuned through GABAergic interneurons. Dysregulation of inhibition can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders, yet little is known about the molecular basis underlying inhibitory control. Here, we find that excessive GABA release from basket cells (BCs) attenuates the firing frequency of Purkinje neurons (PNs) in the cerebellum of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout (KO) mice, a model of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) with abrogated expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). This over-inhibition originates from increased excitability and Ca        2+ transients in the presynaptic terminals, where Kv1.2 potassium channels are downregulated. By paired patch-clamp recordings, we further demonstrate that acutely introducing an N-terminal fragment of FMRP into BCs normalizes GABA release in the Fmr1-KO synapses. Conversely, direct injection of an inhibitory FMRP antibody into BCs, or membrane depolarization of BCs, enhances GABA release in the wild type synapses, leading to abnormal inhibitory transmission comparable to the Fmr1-KO neurons. We discover that the N-terminus of FMRP directly binds to a phosphorylated serine motif on the C-terminus of Kv1.2; and that loss of this interaction in BCs exaggerates GABA release, compromising the firing activity of PNs and thus the output from the cerebellar circuitry. An allosteric Kv1.2 agonist, docosahexaenoic acid, rectifies the dysregulated inhibition in vitro as well as acoustic startle reflex and social interaction in vivo of the Fmr1-KO mice. Our results unravel a novel molecular locus for targeted intervention of FXS and perhaps autism.
30231625	Sensory Processing Phenotypes in Fragile X Syndrome.         autism spectrum disorders, fragile X syndrome, neurodevelopmental disorders, sensory hypersensitivity Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes intellectual disability. It is a leading known genetic cause of autism. In addition to cognitive, social, and communication deficits, humans with FXS demonstrate abnormal sensory processing including sensory hypersensitivity. Sensory hypersensitivity commonly manifests as auditory, tactile, or visual defensiveness or avoidance. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity, impaired habituation to repeated sounds, and reduced auditory attention in humans with FXS. Children with FXS also exhibit significant visuospatial impairments. Studies in infants and toddlers with FXS have documented impairments in processing texture-defined motion stimuli, temporal flicker, perceiving ordinal numerical sequence, and the ability to maintain the identity of dynamic object information during occlusion. Consistent with the observations in humans with FXS, fragile X mental retardation 1 ( Fmr1) gene knockout (KO) rodent models of FXS also show seizures, abnormal visual-evoked responses, auditory hypersensitivity, and abnormal processing at multiple levels of the auditory system, including altered acoustic startle responses. Among other sensory symptoms, individuals with FXS exhibit tactile defensiveness. Fmr1 KO mice also show impaired encoding of tactile stimulation frequency and larger size of receptive fields in the somatosensory cortex. Since sensory deficits are relatively more tractable from circuit mechanisms and developmental perspectives than more complex social behaviors, the focus of this review is on clinical, functional, and structural studies that outline the auditory, visual, and somatosensory processing deficits in FXS. The similarities in sensory phenotypes between humans with FXS and animal models suggest a likely conservation of basic sensory processing circuits across species and may provide a translational platform to not just develop biomarkers but also to understand underlying mechanisms. We argue that preclinical studies in animal models of FXS can facilitate the ongoing search for new therapeutic approaches in FXS by understanding mechanisms of basic sensory processing circuits and behaviors that are conserved across species.        
30233641	Sensory Difficulties in Children With an FMR1 Premutation.         FMR1 premutation, feeding behavior, fragile X syndrome, hypersensitivity, hyposensitivity, sensory processing Abnormal sensory processing is one of the core characteristics of the fragile X phenotype. Studies of young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and the FMR1 premutation have shown sensory challenges as early as infancy and into early childhood. This study sought to examine differences in sensory difficulties in children with an FMR1 premutation compared with children with FXS and typically developing children. We conducted an online survey of 176 parents of affected children (FXS or FMR1 premutation). Most respondents were mothers who are Caucasian (86%), have a 4-year college or graduate degree (68%), and are married (92%). Children ranged in age from 5 to 18, with a mean age of 13.0 years (3.3 SD). Participants completed the BBC Sensory Scales, a 50-item Likert-type scale (1 = Almost Always, 4 = Almost Never) comprised of 8 subscales that assessed auditory processing, visual processing, tactile processing, and eating and feeding behaviors. Mean scores were calculated for the items and each of the subscales. Non-parametric tests examined differences in child and family-level variables. Across all BBCSS subscales, children with an FMR1 premutation displayed more sensory challenges than typically developing children. For six out of the eight subscales, children with the full mutation had the lowest scores indicating more sensory challenges, but this was closely followed by children with an FMR1 premutation. Fragile X status was associated with seven of the eight subscales; children with an FMR1 premutation did not differ from children with FXS on any of the subscales but had more digestive problems than children with no fragile X. Gender, autism status, and family income were also related to sensory sensitivities. In conclusion, these data provide further evidence that some children with an FMR1 premutation experience sensory difficulties that are similar to children with FXS but different than typically developing children.        
30242133	Activation of autophagy rescues synaptic and cognitive deficits in fragile X mice.         autism, autophagy, cognition, fragile X syndrome, mTOR Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of heritable intellectual disability and autism. Fragile X (        Fmr1-KO) mice exhibit aberrant dendritic spine structure, synaptic plasticity, and cognition. Autophagy is a catabolic process of programmed degradation and recycling of proteins and cellular components via the lysosomal pathway. However, a role for autophagy in the pathophysiology of FXS is, as yet, unclear. Here we show that autophagic flux, a functional readout of autophagy, and biochemical markers of autophagy are down-regulated in hippocampal neurons of fragile X mice. We further show that enhanced activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and translocation of Raptor, a defining component of mTORC1, to the lysosome are causally related to reduced autophagy. Activation of autophagy by delivery of shRNA to Raptor directly into the CA1 of living mice via the lentivirus expression system largely corrects aberrant spine structure, synaptic plasticity, and cognition in fragile X mice. Postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95) and activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1), proteins implicated in spine structure and synaptic plasticity, respectively, are elevated in neurons lacking fragile X mental retardation protein. Activation of autophagy corrects PSD-95 and Arc abundance, identifying a potential mechanism by which impaired autophagy is causally related to the fragile X phenotype and revealing a previously unappreciated role for autophagy in the synaptic and cognitive deficits associated with fragile X syndrome.
25784856	"Update on the implication of potassium channels in autism: K(+) channelautism spectrum disorder.         FMRP (FMR1), K+ channels, KCa1.1 (KCNMA1), Kir2.1 (KCNJ2), Kir4.1 (KCNJ10), Kv4.2 (KCND2), Kv7.3(KCNQ3), channelASD-channelepsy phenotype Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impaired ability to properly implement environmental stimuli that are essential to achieve a state of social and cultural exchange. Indeed, the main features of ASD are impairments of interpersonal relationships, verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors. These aspects are often accompanied by several comorbidities such as motor delay, praxis impairment, gait abnormalities, insomnia, and above all epilepsy. Genetic analyses of autistic individuals uncovered deleterious mutations in several K(+) channel types strengthening the notion that their intrinsic dysfunction may play a central etiologic role in ASD. However, indirect implication of K(+) channels in ASD has been also reported. For instance, loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in K(+) channels deregulation, network dysfunction and ASD-like cognitive and behavioral symptoms. This review provides an update on direct and indirect implications of K(+) channels in ASDs. Owing to a mounting body of evidence associating a channelopathy pathogenesis to autism and showing that nearly 500 ion channel proteins are encoded by the human genome, we propose to classify ASDs - whose susceptibility is significantly enhanced by ion channels defects, either in a monogenic or multigenic condition - in a new category named "" c hannel A utism S pectrum D isorder"" (channelASD; cASD) and introduce a new taxonomy (e.g., Kv x.y-channelASD and likewise Nav x.y-channelASD, Cav x.y-channelASD; etc.). This review also highlights some degree of clinical and genetic overlap between K(+) channelASDs and K(+) channelepsies, whereby such correlation suggests that a subcategory characterized by a channelASD-channelepsy phenotype may be distinguished. Ultimately, this overview aims to further understand the different clinical subgroups and help parse out the distinct biological basis of autism that are essential to establish patient-tailored treatments.

25790165	The GABAA receptor is an FMRP target with therapeutic potential in fragile X syndrome.         FMRP mRNA target, Fmr1 knockout mouse, GABAA receptor, fragile X syndrome, ganaxolone, targeted therapy Previous research indicates that the GABAAergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of the fragile X syndrome, a frequent form of inherited intellectual disability and associated with autism spectrum disorder. However, the molecular mechanism underlying GABAAergic deficits has remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate reduced mRNA expression of GABAA receptor subunits in the cortex and cerebellum of young Fmr1 knockout mice. In addition, we show that the previously reported underexpression of specific subunits of the GABAA receptor can be corrected in YAC transgenic rescue mice, containing the full-length human FMR1 gene in an Fmr1 knockout background. Moreover, we demonstrate that FMRP directly binds several GABAA receptor mRNAs. Finally, positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors with the neurosteroid ganaxolone can modulate specific behaviors in Fmr1 knockout mice, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of the receptor.         
25804740	Activity-dependent FMRP requirements in development of the neural circuitry of learning and memory.         Channelrhodopsin, Critical period, Dendrite, Drosophila, Fmr1, Fragile X syndrome, Halorhodopsin, Mushroom body, Synapse The activity-dependent refinement of neural circuit connectivity during critical periods of brain development is essential for optimized behavioral performance. We hypothesize that this mechanism is defective in fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Here, we use optogenetic tools in the Drosophila FXS disease model to test activity-dependent dendritogenesis in two extrinsic neurons of the mushroom body (MB) learning and memory brain center: (1) the input projection neuron (PN) innervating Kenyon cells (KCs) in the MB calyx microglomeruli and (2) the output MVP2 neuron innervated by KCs in the MB peduncle. Both input and output neuron classes exhibit distinctive activity-dependent critical period dendritic remodeling. MVP2 arbors expand in Drosophila mutants null for fragile X mental retardation 1 (dfmr1), as well as following channelrhodopsin-driven depolarization during critical period development, but are reduced by halorhodopsin-driven hyperpolarization. Optogenetic manipulation of PNs causes the opposite outcome--reduced dendritic arbors following channelrhodopsin depolarization and expanded arbors following halorhodopsin hyperpolarization during development. Importantly, activity-dependent dendritogenesis in both neuron classes absolutely requires dfmr1 during one developmental window. These results show that dfmr1 acts in a neuron type-specific activity-dependent manner for sculpting dendritic arbors during early-use, critical period development of learning and memory circuitry in the Drosophila brain.          
17074338	The FMR1 premutation and reproduction.          To update clinicians on the reproductive implications of premutations in FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1). Fragile X syndrome, a cause of mental retardation and autism, is due to a full mutation (>200 CGG repeats). Initially, individuals who carried the premutation (defined as more than 55 but less than 200 CGG repeats) were not considered at risk for any clinical disorders. It is now recognized that this was incorrect, specifically with respect to female reproduction.          
27902989	Plasma Levels of Leptin and Adiponectin in Fragile X Syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retardation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene, resulting in the transcriptional silencing of the gene. Leptin may be considered a cytokine-like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions and the immune system response, in addition to playing a role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. The involvement of leptin and adiponectin in the pathophysiology of FXS was hypothesized.          
27904820	The neurobiology of the Prader-Willi phenotype of fragile X syndrome.         Autism, FMR1 gene, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Growth hormone, Hyperphagia, IGF-1, Prader-Willi phenotype Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism, caused by a CGG expansion to greater than 200 repeats in the promoter region of         FMR1 on the bottom of the X chromosome. A subgroup of individuals with FXS experience hyperphagia, lack of satiation after meals and severe obesity, this subgroup is referred to have the Prader-Willi phenotype of FXS. Prader-Willi syndrome is one of the most common genetic severe obesity disorders known and it is caused by the lack of the paternal 15q11-13 region. Affected individuals suffer from hyperphagia, lack of satiation, intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. Children with fragile X syndrome Prader-Willi phenotye and those with Prader Willi syndrome have clinical and molecular similarities reviewed here which will impact new treatment options for both disorders.
27916527	Dynamic mRNA Transport and Local Translation in Radial Glial Progenitors of the Developing Brain.         FMRP, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA localization, corticogenesis, embryonic brain, live imaging, local translation, neural stem cell, neurogenesis, radial glia In the developing brain, neurons are produced from neural stem cells termed radial glia [1, 2]. Radial glial progenitors span the neuroepithelium, extending long basal processes to form endfeet hundreds of micrometers away from the soma. Basal structures influence neuronal migration, tissue integrity, and proliferation [3-7]. Yet, despite the significance of these distal structures, their cell biology remains poorly characterized, impeding our understanding of how basal processes and endfeet influence neurogenesis. Here we use live imaging of embryonic brain tissue to visualize, for the first time, rapid mRNA transport in radial glia, revealing that the basal process is a highway for directed molecular transport. RNA- and mRNA-binding proteins, including the syndromic autism protein FMRP, move in basal processes at velocities consistent with microtubule-based transport, accumulating in endfeet. We develop an ex vivo tissue preparation to mechanically isolate radial glia endfeet from the soma, and we use photoconvertible proteins to demonstrate that mRNA is locally translated. Using RNA immunoprecipitation and microarray analyses of endfeet, we discover FMRP-bound transcripts, which encode signaling and cytoskeletal regulators, including many implicated in autism and neurogenesis. We show FMRP controls transport and localization of one target, Kif26a. These discoveries reveal a rich, regulated local transcriptome in radial glia, far from the soma, and establish a tractable mammalian model for studying mRNA transport and local translation in vivo. We conclude that cytoskeletal and signaling events at endfeet may be controlled through translation of specific mRNAs transported from the soma, exposing new mechanistic layers within stem cells of the developing brain.          
25920745	High functioning male with fragile X syndrome and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.         FXTAS, fragile X syndrome Fragile X syndrome (FXS) affects individuals with more than 200 CGG repeats (full mutation) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Those born with FXS experience cognitive and social impairments, developmental delays, and some features of autism spectrum disorders. Carriers of a premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) are generally not severely affected early in life; however, are at high risk of developing the late onset neurodegenerative disorder, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), or Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and may have other medical conditions such as developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders, hypertension, anxiety, and immune-mediated disorders. Here we present a case of a 58-year-old man with a borderline IQ, average memory skills, and executive function deficits. He met criteria for multiple psychiatric diagnoses and presented with tremor and ataxia, meeting criteria for FXTAS. Molecular testing unveiled a completely unmethylated FMR1 full mutation in peripheral blood mononucleated cells with elevated FMR1 mRNA and premutation alleles of different sizes in two other tissues (primary fibroblasts and sperm), indicating the presence of allele instability based on both inter- and intra-tissue mosaicism. The observation of FXTAS in this case of a full mutation mosaic man suggests that the pathogenic mechanism underlying this disorder is not observed exclusively in premutation carriers as it was originally thought. The concomitant presence of features of FXS and late onset neurological deterioration with probable FXTAS likely result from a combined molecular pathology of elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, a molecular hallmark of FXTAS and low FMRP expression that leads to FXS.          
24115651	Fragile X syndrome: From protein function to therapy.         FMR1, FMRP, Fmr1 KO mouse, fragile X syndrome, intellectual disability, protein function, review, treatment Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism. The FMR1 gene contains a CGG repeat present in the 5'-untranslated region which can be unstable upon transmission to the next generation. The repeat is up to 55 CGGs long in the normal population. In patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a repeat length exceeding 200 CGGs generally leads to methylation of the repeat and the promoter region, which is accompanied by silencing of the FMR1 gene. The disease is a result of lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein leading to severe symptoms, including intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and autistic-like behavior. The FMR1 protein (FMRP) has a number of functions. The translational dysregulation of a subset of mRNAs targeted by FMRP is probably the major contribution to FXS. FMRP is also involved in mRNA transport to synapses where protein synthesis occurs. For some FMRP-bound mRNAs, FMRP is a direct modulator of mRNA stability either by sustaining or preventing mRNA decay. Increased knowledge about the role of FMRP has led to the identification of potential treatments for fragile X syndrome that were often tested first in the different animal models. This review gives an overview about the present knowledge of the function of FMRP and the therapeutic strategies in mouse and man.          
24141422	Genetic and acute CPEB1 depletion ameliorate fragile X pathophysiology.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited mental retardation and autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of FMR1, which encodes the translational repressor fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), an activator of translation, are present in neuronal dendrites, are predicted to bind many of the same mRNAs and may mediate a translational homeostasis that, when imbalanced, results in FXS. Consistent with this possibility, Fmr1(-/y); Cpeb1(-/-) double-knockout mice displayed amelioration of biochemical, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes associated with FXS. Acute depletion of CPEB1 in the hippocampus of adult Fmr1(-/y) mice rescued working memory deficits, demonstrating reversal of this FXS phenotype. Finally, we find that FMRP and CPEB1 balance translation at the level of polypeptide elongation. Our results suggest that disruption of translational homeostasis is causal for FXS and that the maintenance of this homeostasis by FMRP and CPEB1 is necessary for normal neurologic function.         
22615862	The therapeutic effect of memantine through the stimulation of synapse formation and dendritic spine maturation in autism and fragile X syndrome.          Although the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie autism are not well understood, there is evidence showing that metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors are hyper-stimulated and the GABAergic system is hypo-stimulated in autism. Memantine is an uncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors and is widely prescribed for treatment of Alzheimer's disease treatment. Recently, it has been shown to improve language function, social behavior, and self-stimulatory behaviors of some autistic subjects. However the mechanism by which memantine exerts its effect remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) from Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model for fragile X syndrome (FXS) and syndromic autism, to examine the effects of memantine on dendritic spine development and synapse formation. Our results show that the maturation of dendritic spines is delayed in Fmr1-KO CGCs. We also detected reduced excitatory synapse formation in Fmr1-KO CGCs. Memantine treatment of Fmr1-KO CGCs promoted cell adhesion properties. Memantine also stimulated the development of mushroom-shaped mature dendritic spines and restored dendritic spine to normal levels in Fmr1-KO CGCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that memantine treatment promoted synapse formation and restored the excitatory synapses to a normal range in Fmr1-KO CGCs. These findings suggest that memantine may exert its therapeutic capacity through a stimulatory effect on dendritic spine maturation and excitatory synapse formation, as well as promoting adhesion of CGCs.        
28301083	Age-specific autistic-like behaviors in heterozygous Fmr1-KO female mice.         Fragile X syndrome, adolescence, animal models, autism, developmental disorders, social interactions, ultrasonic vocalizations Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a major developmental disorder and the most frequent monogenic cause of autism. Surprisingly, most existing studies on the Fmr1-KO mouse model for FXS have focused on males, although FX women, who are mostly heterozygous for the Fmr1 mutation, are known to exhibit several behavioral deficits, including autistic-like features. Furthermore, most animal research has been carried out on adults only; so that little is known about the age progression of the behavioral phenotype of Fmr1 mutants, which is a crucial issue to optimize the impact of therapeutic interventions. Here, we performed an extensive analysis of autistic-like social behaviors in heterozygous (HET) Fmr1-KO females and their WT littermates at different ages. No behavioral difference between HET and WT mice was observed at infancy, but some abnormalities in social interaction and communication were first detected at juvenile age. At adulthood some of these alterations disappeared, but avoidance of social novelty appeared, together with other FXS-relevant behavioral deficits, such as hyperactivity and reduced contextual fear response. Our data provide for the first time evidence for the presence of autistic-relevant behavioral abnormalities in Fmr1-HET female mice, demonstrating the utility of this mouse line to model autistic-like behaviors in both sexes. These results also highlight the importance of taking into account age differences when using the Fmr1-KO mouse model, suggesting that the early post-natal phases are the most promising target for preventive interventions and the adult age is the most appropriate to investigate the behavioral impact of potential therapies.

22113615	Mutations causing syndromic autism define an axis of synaptic pathophysiology.          Tuberous sclerosis complex and fragile X syndrome are genetic diseases characterized by intellectual disability and autism. Because both syndromes are caused by mutations in genes that regulate protein synthesis in neurons, it has been hypothesized that excessive protein synthesis is one core pathophysiological mechanism of intellectual disability and autism. Using electrophysiological and biochemical assays of neuronal protein synthesis in the hippocampus of Tsc2(+/-) and Fmr1(-/y) mice, here we show that synaptic dysfunction caused by these mutations actually falls at opposite ends of a physiological spectrum. Synaptic, biochemical and cognitive defects in these mutants are corrected by treatments that modulate metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in opposite directions, and deficits in the mutants disappear when the mice are bred to carry both mutations. Thus, normal synaptic plasticity and cognition occur within an optimal range of metabotropic glutamate-receptor-mediated protein synthesis, and deviations in either direction can lead to shared behavioural impairments.        
24432860	Physiological arousal in autism and fragile X syndrome: group comparisons and links with pragmatic language.          This study tested the hypothesis that pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairment is linked to arousal dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and fragile X syndrome (FXS). Forty boys with ASD, 39 with FXS, and 27 with typical development (TD), aged 4-15 years, participated. Boys with FXS were hyperaroused compared to boys with TD but did not differ from boys with ASD. Dampened vagal tone predicted pragmatic impairment in ASD, and associations emerged between cardiac activity and receptive/expressive vocabulary across groups. Findings support autonomic dysfunction as a mechanism underlying pragmatic impairment in ASD and suggest that biophysiological profiles are shared in ASD and FXS, which has implications for understanding the role of fragile X mental retardation-1 (FMR1, the FXS gene) in the pathophysiology of ASD.        
24448548	Fragile X syndrome due to a missense mutation.          Fragile X syndrome is a common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Most patients exhibit a massive CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the FMR1 gene that silences the locus. In over two decades since the discovery of FMR1, only a single missense mutation (p.(Ile304Asn)) has been reported as causing fragile X syndrome. Here we describe a 16-year-old male presenting with fragile X syndrome but without the repeat expansion mutation. Rather, we find a missense mutation, c.797G>A, that replaces glycine 266 with glutamic acid (p.(Gly266Glu)). The Gly266Glu FMR protein abolished many functional properties of the protein. This patient highlights the diagnostic utility of FMR1 sequencing.         
24448645	Long-term memory deficits are associated with elevated synaptic ERK1/2 activation and reversed by mGluR5 antagonism in an animal model of autism.          A significant proportion of patients with autism exhibit some degree of intellectual disability. The BTBR T(+) Itpr3(tf)/J mouse strain exhibits behaviors that align with the major diagnostic criteria of autism. To further evaluate the BTBR strain's cognitive impairments, we quantified hippocampus-dependent object location memory (OLM) and found that one-third of the BTBR mice exhibited robust memory, whereas the remainder did not. Fluorescence deconvolution tomography was used to test whether synaptic levels of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), a protein that contributes importantly to plasticity, correlate with OLM scores in individual mice. In hippocampal field CA1, the BTBRs had fewer post-synaptic densities associated with high levels of phosphorylated (p-) ERK1/2 as compared with C57BL/6 mice. Although counts of p-ERK1/2 immunoreactive synapses did not correlate with OLM performance, the intensity of synaptic p-ERK1/2 immunolabeling was negatively correlated with OLM scores across BTBRs. Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 5 signaling activates ERK1/2. Therefore, we tested whether treatment with the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP normalizes synaptic and learning measures in BTBR mice: MPEP facilitated OLM and decreased synaptic p-ERK1/2 immunolabeling intensity without affecting numbers of p-ERK1/2+ synapses. In contrast, semi-chronic ampakine treatment, which facilitates memory in other models of cognitive impairment, had no effect on OLM in BTBRs. These results suggest that intellectual disabilities associated with different neurodevelopmental disorders on the autism spectrum require distinct therapeutic strategies based on underlying synaptic pathology.         
24463507	De novo mutations in schizophrenia implicate synaptic networks.          Inherited alleles account for most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations, affecting one or a few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations are additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to modulate synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics and those whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those mutated in autism and intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic pathways. Aligning our findings with a parallel case-control study, we demonstrate reproducible insights into aetiological mechanisms for schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders.         
24463508	A polygenic burden of rare disruptive mutations in schizophrenia.          Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in neuropsychiatric disease.         
24463622	CNS expression of murine fragile X protein (FMRP) as a function of CGG-repeat size.          Large expansions of a CGG-repeat element (>200 repeats; full mutation) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading single-gene form of intellectual disability and of autism spectrum disorder. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; premutation) result in the neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Whereas FXS is caused by gene silencing and insufficient FMR1 protein (FMRP), FXTAS is thought to be caused by 'toxicity' of expanded-CGG-repeat mRNA. However, as FMRP expression levels decrease with increasing CGG-repeat length, lowered protein may contribute to premutation-associated clinical involvement. To address this issue, we measured brain Fmr1 mRNA and FMRP levels as a function of CGG-repeat length in a congenic (CGG-repeat knock-in) mouse model using 57 wild-type and 97 expanded-CGG-repeat mice carrying up to ~250 CGG repeats. While Fmr1 message levels increased with repeat length, FMRP levels trended downward over the same range, subject to significant inter-subject variation. Human comparisons of protein levels in the frontal cortex of 7 normal and 17 FXTAS individuals revealed that the mild FMRP decrease in mice mirrored the more limited data for FMRP expression in the human samples. In addition, FMRP expression levels varied in a subset of mice across the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus, as well as at different ages. These results provide a foundation for understanding both the CGG-repeat-dependence of FMRP expression and for interpreting clinical phenotypes in premutation carriers in terms of the balance between elevated mRNA and lowered FMRP expression levels.          
21827901	Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.          Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an under-recognized disorder that is a significant cause of late-adult-onset ataxia. The etiology is expansion of a trinucleotide repeat to the premutation range (55-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Expansion to >200 CGGs causes fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable cause of cognitive impairment and autism. Core features of FXTAS include progressive action tremor and gait ataxia; with frequent, more variable features of cognitive decline, especially executive dysfunction, parkinsonism, neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction. MR imaging shows generalized atrophy and frequently abnormal signal in the middle cerebellar peduncles. Autopsy reveals intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes and dystrophic white matter. FXTAS is likely due to an RNA toxic gain-of-function of the expanded-repeat mRNA. The disorder typically affects male premutation carriers over age 50, and, less often, females. Females also are at increased risk for primary ovarian insufficiency, chronic muscle pain, and thyroid disease. Treatment targets specific symptoms, but progression of disability is relentless. Although the contribution of FXTAS to the morbidity and mortality of the aging population requires further study, the disorder is likely the most common single-gene form of tremor and ataxia in the older adult population.          
22043169	Fragile x syndrome.         Fragile X, Prader-Willi phenotype, mGluR antagonists., obesity, trinucleotide repeat Recent data from a national survey highlighted a significant difference in obesity rates in young fragile X males (31%) compared to age matched controls (18%). Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of intellectual disability in males and the most common single gene cause of autism. This X-linked disorder is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide CGG repeat (>200) on the promotor region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). As a result, the promotor region often becomes methylated which leads to a deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). Common characteristics of FXS include mild to severe cognitive impairments in males but less severe cognitive impairment in females. Physical features of FXS include an elongated face, prominent ears, and post-pubertal macroorchidism. Severe obesity in full mutation males is often associated with the Prader-Willi phenotype (PWP) which includes hyperphagia, lack of satiation after meals, and hypogonadism or delayed puberty; however, there is no deletion at 15q11-q13 nor uniparental maternal disomy. Herein, we discuss the molecular mechanisms leading to FXS and the Prader-Willi phenotype with an emphasis on mouse FMR1 knockout studies that have shown the reversal of weight increase through mGluR antagonists. Finally, we review the current medications used in treatment of FXS including the atypical antipsychotics that can lead to weight gain and the research regarding the use of targeted treatments in FXS that will hopefully have a significantly beneficial effect on cognition and behavior without weight gain.        
22046307	Reversal of fragile X phenotypes by manipulation of AβPP/Aβ levels in Fmr1KO mice.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the leading known genetic cause of autism. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent or expressed at substantially reduced levels in FXS, binds to and controls the postsynaptic translation of amyloid β-protein precursor (AβPP) mRNA. Cleavage of AβPP can produce β-amyloid (Aβ), a 39-43 amino acid peptide mis-expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS). Aβ is over-expressed in the brain of Fmr1(KO) mice, suggesting a pathogenic role in FXS. To determine if genetic reduction of AβPP/Aβ rescues characteristic FXS phenotypes, we assessed audiogenic seizures (AGS), anxiety, the ratio of mature versus immature dendritic spines and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in Fmr1(KO) mice after removal of one App allele. All of these phenotypes were partially or completely reverted to normal. Plasma Aβ(1-42) was significantly reduced in full-mutation FXS males compared to age-matched controls while cortical and hippocampal levels were somewhat increased, suggesting that Aβ is sequestered in the brain. Evolving therapies directed at reducing Aβ in AD may be applicable to FXS and Aβ may serve as a plasma-based biomarker to facilitate disease diagnosis or assess therapeutic efficacy.        
19932134	Altered neuroligin expression is involved in social deficits in a mouse model of the fragile X syndrome.          The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. Caused by a transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a mRNA binding protein itself, misregulated translation is thought to be the leading cause of the fragile X syndrome. Interestingly, recent results indicated several neuroligin interacting proteins to be affected by this misregulation, including neurexin1 and PSD95, which have also been implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays and RT-PCR, FMRP is shown to interact with neuroligin1- and 2-mRNA, while no interaction with neuroligin3-mRNA is observed. In line with FMRP's role in translation regulation, Western blot as well as immunohistochemistry analysis reveal changes in protein expression levels suggesting impaired synaptic function. As increasing evidence indicates neuroligin expression to be critical for synapse maturation and function, consequences of impaired neuroligin1 expression in FXS are assessed by overexpressing HA-neuroligin1 in FMR1-/- mice, a model for FXS. Behavioural assessments demonstrate that enhanced neuroligin1 expression improves social behaviour in FMR1-/- mice, whereas no positive effect on learning and memory is seen. These results provide for the first time evidence for an involvement of a neuroligin-neurexin protein network in core symptoms of FXS.          
22579290	Species-dependent posttranscriptional regulation of NOS1 by FMRP in the developing cerebral cortex.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism, results from loss of function of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Here, we show that FMRP regulates translation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) in the developing human neocortex. Whereas NOS1 mRNA is widely expressed, NOS1 protein is transiently coexpressed with FMRP during early synaptogenesis in layer- and region-specific pyramidal neurons. These include midfetal layer 5 subcortically projecting neurons arranged into alternating columns in the prospective Broca's area and orofacial motor cortex. Human NOS1 translation is activated by FMRP via interactions with coding region binding motifs absent from mouse Nos1 mRNA, which is expressed in mouse pyramidal neurons, but not efficiently translated. Correspondingly, neocortical NOS1 protein levels are severely reduced in developing human FXS cases, but not FMRP-deficient mice. Thus, alterations in FMRP posttranscriptional regulation of NOS1 in developing neocortical circuits may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in FXS.          
16108982	Blink rate in boys with fragile X syndrome: preliminary evidence for altered dopamine function.          Dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in motor and cognitive functioning, can be non-invasively measured via observation of spontaneous blink rates. Blink rates have been studied in a number of clinical conditions including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinsons, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder with results implicating either hyper or hypo dopaminergic states.          
29892074	Impaired hippocampal representation of place in the Fmr1-knockout mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-chromosome linked intellectual disability and the most common known inherited single gene cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Building upon demonstrated deficits in neuronal plasticity and spatial memory in FXS, we investigated how spatial information processing is affected in vivo in an FXS mouse model (Fmr1-KO). Healthy hippocampal neurons (so-called place cells) exhibit place-related activity during spatial exploration, and their firing fields tend to remain stable over time. In contrast, we find impaired stability and reduced specificity of Fmr1-KO spatial representations. This is a potential biomarker for the cognitive dysfunction observed in FXS, informative on the ability to integrate sensory information into an abstract representation and successfully retain this conceptual memory. Our results provide key insight into the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive disabilities in FXS and ASD, paving the way for a targeted approach to remedy these.        
29901787	Dysfunctional Autism Risk Genes Cause Circuit-Specific Connectivity Deficits With Distinct Developmental Trajectories.          Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of complex neurodevelopmental disorders for which there is currently no targeted therapeutic approach. It is thought that alterations of genes regulating migration and synapse formation during development affect neural circuit formation and result in aberrant connectivity within distinct circuits that underlie abnormal behaviors. However, it is unknown whether deviant developmental trajectories are circuit-specific for a given autism risk-gene. We used MRI to probe changes in functional and structural connectivity from childhood to adulthood in Fragile-X (Fmr1-/y) and contactin-associated (CNTNAP2-/-) knockout mice. Young Fmr1-/y mice (30 days postnatal) presented with a robust hypoconnectivity phenotype in corticocortico and corticostriatal circuits in areas associated with sensory information processing, which was maintained until adulthood. Conversely, only small differences in hippocampal and striatal areas were present during early postnatal development in CNTNAP2-/- mice, while major connectivity deficits in prefrontal and limbic pathways developed between adolescence and adulthood. These findings are supported by viral tracing and electron micrograph approaches and define 2 clearly distinct connectivity endophenotypes within the autism spectrum. We conclude that the genetic background of ASD strongly influences which circuits are most affected, the nature of the phenotype, and the developmental time course of the associated changes.        
27865048	Neuroligin 2 nonsense variant associated with anxiety, autism, intellectual disability, hyperphagia, and obesity.         NLGN2, anxiety, autism, obesity, synaptic function Neuroligins are post-synaptic, cellular adhesion molecules implicated in synaptic formation and function. NLGN2 is strongly linked to inhibitory, GABAergic signaling and is crucial for maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain. Disruption of the excitation-inhibition balance is associated with neuropsychiatric disease. In animal models, altered NLGN2 expression causes anxiety, developmental delay, motor discoordination, social impairment, aggression, and sensory processing defects. In humans, mutations in NLGN3 and NLGN4 are linked to autism and schizophrenia; NLGN2 missense variants are implicated in schizophrenia. Copy number variants encompassing NLGN2 on 17p13.1 are associated with autism, intellectual disability, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and dysmorphic features, but an isolated NLGN2 nonsense variant has not yet been described in humans. Here, we describe a 15-year-old male with severe anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, developmental delay, autism, obesity, macrocephaly, and some dysmorphic features. Exome sequencing identified a heterozygous, de novo, c.441C>A p.(Tyr147Ter) variant in NLGN2 that is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function. This is the first report of an NLGN2 nonsense variant in humans, adding to the accumulating evidence that links synaptic proteins with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.          
27881780	"Negative Allosteric Modulation of mGluR5 Partially Corrects Pathophysiology in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome.         Rett syndrome, autism, fragile X, intellectual disability, metabotropic glutamate receptor, synaptic protein synthesis Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), an epigenetic regulator of mRNA transcription. Here, we report a test of the hypothesis of shared pathophysiology of RTT and fragile X, another monogenic cause of autism and intellectual disability. In fragile X, the loss of the mRNA translational repressor FMRP leads to exaggerated protein synthesis downstream of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We found that mGluR5- and protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity were similarly altered in area CA1 of Mecp2 KO mice. CA1 pyramidal cell-type-specific, genome-wide profiling of ribosome-bound mRNAs was performed in wild-type and Mecp2 KO hippocampal CA1 neurons to reveal the MeCP2-regulated ""translatome."" We found significant overlap between ribosome-bound transcripts overexpressed in the Mecp2 KO and FMRP mRNA targets. These tended to encode long genes that were functionally related to either cytoskeleton organization or the development of neuronal connectivity. In the Fmr1 KO mouse, chronic treatment with mGluR5-negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) has been shown to ameliorate many mutant phenotypes by correcting excessive protein synthesis. In Mecp2 KO mice, we found that mGluR5 NAM treatment significantly reduced the level of overexpressed ribosome-associated transcripts, particularly those that were also FMRP targets. Some Rett phenotypes were also ameliorated by treatment, most notably hippocampal cell size and lifespan. Together, these results suggest a potential mechanistic link between MeCP2-mediated transcription regulation and mGluR5/FMRP-mediated protein translation regulation through coregulation of a subset of genes relevant to synaptic functions.

28077511	Altered Connectivity and Synapse Maturation of the Hippocampal Mossy Fiber Pathway in a Mouse Model of the Fragile X Syndrome.         actin, behavior, plasticity, spines The Fragile X syndrome (FXS) as the most common monogenetic cause of cognitive impairment and autism indicates how tightly the dysregulation of synapse development is linked to cognitive deficits. Symptoms of FXS include excessive adherence to patterns that point to compromised hippocampal network formation. Surprisingly, one of the most complex hippocampal synapses connecting the dentate gyrus (DG) to CA3 pyramidal neurons has not been analyzed in FXS yet. Intriguingly, we found altered synaptic function between DG and CA3 in a mouse model of FXS (fmr1 knockout [KO]) demonstrated by increased mossy fiber-dependent miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency at CA3 pyramidal neurons together with increased connectivity between granule cells and CA3 neurons. This phenotype is accompanied by increased activity of fmr1 KO animals in the marble burying task, detecting repetitive and obsessive compulsive behavior. Spine apparatus development and insertion of AMPA receptors is enhanced at postsynaptic thorny excrescences (TEs) in fmr1 KO mice. We report age-dependent alterations in TE morphology and in the underlying actin dynamics possibly linked to a dysregulation in profilin1 expression. TEs form detonator synapses guiding CA3 network activity. Thus, alterations described here are likely to contribute substantially to the impairment in hippocampal function and therefore to the pathogenesis of FXS.          
20600866	Evidence of reactive astrocytes but not peripheral immune system activation in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and is one of the few known genetic causes of autism. FXS results from the loss of Fmr1 gene function; thus, Fmr1 knockout mice provide a model to study impairments associated with FXS and autism and to test potential therapeutic interventions. The inhibitory serine phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is lower in brain regions of Fmr1 knockout mice than wild-type mice and the GSK3 inhibitor lithium rescues several behavioral impairments in Fmr1 knockout mice. Therefore, we examined if the serine phosphorylation of GSK3 in Fmr1 knockout mice also was altered outside the brain and if administration of lithium ameliorated the macroorchidism phenotype. Additionally, since GSK3 regulates numerous functions of the immune system and immune alterations have been associated with autism, we tested if immune function is altered in Fmr1 knockout mice. The inhibitory serine phosphorylation of GSK3 was significantly lower in the testis and liver of Fmr1 knockout mice than wild-type mice, and chronic lithium treatment reduced macroorchidism in Fmr1 knockout mice. No alterations in peripheral immune function were identified in Fmr1 knockout mice. However, examination of glia, the immune cells of the brain, revealed reactive astrocytes in several brain regions of Fmr1 knockout mice and treatment with lithium reduced this in the striatum and cerebellum. These results provide further evidence of the involvement of dysregulated GSK3 in FXS, and demonstrate that lithium administration reduces macroorchidism and reactive astrocytes in Fmr1 knockout mice.          
21291308	Exploring the adult life of men and women with fragile X syndrome: results from a national survey.          Using data from a national family survey, the authors describe the adult lives (i.e., residence, employment, level of assistance needed with everyday life, friendships, and leisure activities) of 328 adults with the full mutation of the FMR1 gene and identify characteristics related to independence in these domains. Level of functional skills was the strongest predictor of independence in adult life for men, whereas ability to interact appropriately was the strongest predictor for women. Co-occurring mental health conditions influenced independence in adult life for men and women, in particular, autism spectrum disorders for men and affect problems for women. Services for adults with fragile X syndrome should not only target functional skills but interpersonal skills and co-occurring mental health conditions.        
21162125	"Fragile X mice: reduced long-term potentiation and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor-mediated neurotransmission in dentate gyrus.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic mental retardation syndrome that frequently includes autism. The Fmr1-knockout (Fmr1-KO) mouse, like FXS-affected individuals, lacks the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and models autism as well as FXS. Limited human data and several mouse models have implicated the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in autism. We therefore investigated whether the Fmr1-KO mouse exhibited functional changes in DG. We found diminished medial perforant path-granule cell long-term potentiation (LTP), complementing previous investigations of synaptic plasticity in Fmr1-KO demonstrating impaired LTP in CA1, neocortex, and amygdala and exaggerated long-term depression in CA1. We also found that peak amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was smaller in Fmr1-KO than control. AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs were comparable in the two strains, yielding a lower NMDA/AMPA ratio in Fmr1-KO mice and suggesting one mechanism by which absent FMRP might contribute to diminished LTP. The clinical hallmarks of autism include both excessive adherence to patterns and impaired detection of socially important patterns. The DG has a putative role in pattern separation (for time, space, and features) that has been attributed to granule cell number, firing rates, adult neurogenesis, and even perforant path LTP. DG also contributes to pattern completion in CA3 via its mossy fiber efferents, whose terminals include abundant FMRP in ""fragile X granules."" Together with the present data, these observations suggest that DG is a candidate region for further investigation in autism and that the Fmr1-KO model may be particularly apt.          "
25466251	Pharmacogenetic inhibition of eIF4E-dependent Mmp9 mRNA translation reverses fragile X syndrome-like phenotypes.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading genetic cause of autism. Mutations in Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1 gene) engender exaggerated translation resulting in dendritic spine dysmorphogenesis, synaptic plasticity alterations, and behavioral deficits in mice, which are reminiscent of FXS phenotypes. Using postmortem brains from FXS patients and Fmr1 knockout mice (Fmr1(-/y)), we show that phosphorylation of the mRNA 5' cap binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), is elevated concomitant with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) protein. Genetic or pharmacological reduction of eIF4E phosphorylation rescued core behavioral deficits, synaptic plasticity alterations, and dendritic spine morphology defects via reducing exaggerated translation of Mmp9 mRNA in Fmr1(-/y) mice, whereas MMP-9 overexpression produced several FXS-like phenotypes. These results uncover a mechanism of regulation of synaptic function by translational control of Mmp-9 in FXS, which opens the possibility of new treatment avenues for the diverse neurological and psychiatric aspects of FXS.           
27335463	Inability to activate Rac1-dependent forgetting contributes to behavioral inflexibility in mutants of multiple autism-risk genes.         Drosophila, Rac1, autism, behavioral flexibility, forgetting The etiology of autism is so complicated because it involves the effects of variants of several hundred risk genes along with the contribution of environmental factors. Therefore, it has been challenging to identify the causal paths that lead to the core autistic symptoms such as social deficit, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral inflexibility. As an alternative approach, extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying the convergence of the targets and functions of the autism-risk genes to facilitate mapping out causal paths. In this study, we used a reversal-learning task to measure behavioral flexibility in Drosophila and determined the effects of loss-of-function mutations in multiple autism-risk gene homologs in flies. Mutations of five autism-risk genes with diversified molecular functions all led to a similar phenotype of behavioral inflexibility indicated by impaired reversal-learning. These reversal-learning defects resulted from the inability to forget or rather, specifically, to activate Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1)-dependent forgetting. Thus, behavior-evoked activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting has a converging function for autism-risk genes.        
27345143	Hippocampal dysfunction and cognitive impairment in Fragile-X Syndrome.         Fmr1 knock-out mice, Fragile-X Syndrome, Hippocampus, NMDA receptor, Synaptic plasticity, mGluR theory Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene due to a CGG repeat expansion, resulting in the loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). FMRP is involved in transcriptional regulation and trafficking of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and distal sites both in pre- and post-synaptic terminals. Consequently, FXS is a multifaceted disorder associated with impaired synaptic plasticity. One region of the brain that is significantly impacted by the loss of FMRP is the hippocampus, a structure that plays a critical role in the regulation of mood and cognition. This review provides an overview of the neuropathology of Fragile-X Syndrome, highlighting how structural and synaptic deficits in hippocampal subregions, including the CA1 exhibiting exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor dependent long-term depression and the dentate gyrus displaying hypofunction of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, contribute to cognitive impairments associated with this neurodevelopmental disorder.          
27350105	FMR1 gene mutations in patients with fragile X syndrome and obligate carriers: 30 years of experience in Chile.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and co-morbid autism. It is caused by an amplification of the CGG repeat (>200), which is known as the full mutation, within the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene. Expansions between 55-200 CGG repeats are termed premutation and are associated with a greater risk for fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency. Intermediate alleles, also called the grey zone, include approximately 45-54 repeats and are considered borderline. Individuals with less than 45 repeats have a normal FMR1 gene. We report the occurrence of CGG expansions of the FMR1 gene in Chile among patients with ID and families with a known history of FXS. Here, we present a retrospective review conducted on 2321 cases (2202 probands and 119 relatives) referred for FXS diagnosis and cascade screening at the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA), University of Chile. Samples were analysed using traditional cytogenetic methods and/or PCR. Southern blot was used to confirm the diagnosis. Overall frequency of FMR1 expansions observed among probands was 194 (8·8%), the average age of diagnosis was 8·8 ± 5·4 years. Of 119 family members studied, 72 (60%) were diagnosed with a CGG expansion. Our results indicated that the prevalence of CGG expansions of the FMR1 gene among probands is relatively higher than other populations. The average age of diagnosis is also higher than reference values. PCR and Southern blot represent a reliable molecular technique in the diagnosis of FXS.        
22934085	Social communication and theory of mind in boys with autism and fragile x syndrome.         autism, fragile X syndrome, pragmatic language, social communication, theory of mind Impairments in the social use of language, or pragmatics, constitute a core characteristic of autism. Problems with pragmatic language have also been documented in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a monogenic condition that is the most common known genetic cause of autism. Evidence suggests that social cognitive ability, or theory of mind, may also be impaired in both conditions, and in autism, may importantly relate to pragmatic language ability. Given the substantial overlap observed in autism and FXS, this study aimed to better define those social-communicative phenotypes that overlap in these two conditions by comparing pragmatic language ability and theory of mind in children with idiopathic autism and children with FXS, with and without autism, as well as children with Down syndrome and typically developing controls. We further examined correlations between these cognitive-behavioral phenotypes and molecular genetic variation related to the Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 gene (FMR1) in the FXS group. Results indicated that children with idiopathic autism and those with FXS and autism performed comparably on direct-assessment measures of pragmatic language and theory of mind, whereas those with FXS only did not differ from controls. Theory of mind was related to pragmatic language ability in all groups. Pragmatic language and theory of mind also correlated with genetic variation at the FMR1 locus (Cytosine-Guanine-Guanine repeats and percent methylation). These results point toward substantial overlap in the social and language phenotypes in autism and FXS and suggest a molecular genetic basis to these phenotypic profiles.        
21976507	Altered neocortical rhythmic activity states in Fmr1 KO mice are due to enhanced mGluR5 signaling and involve changes in excitatory circuitry.          Despite the pronounced neurological deficits associated with mental retardation and autism, the degree to which neocortical circuit function is altered remains unknown. Here, we study changes in neocortical network function in the form of persistent activity states in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome--the Fmr1 knock-out (KO). Persistent activity states, or UP states, in the neocortex underlie the slow oscillation which occurs predominantly during slow-wave sleep, but may also play a role during awake states. We show that spontaneously occurring UP states in the primary somatosensory cortex are 38-67% longer in Fmr1 KO slices. In vivo, UP states reoccur with a clear rhythmic component consistent with that of the slow oscillation and are similarly longer in the Fmr1 KO. Changes in neocortical excitatory circuitry likely play the major role in this alteration as supported by three findings: (1) longer UP states occur in slices of isolated neocortex, (2) pharmacologically isolated excitatory circuits in Fmr1 KO neocortical slices display prolonged bursting states, and (3) selective deletion of Fmr1 in cortical excitatory neurons is sufficient to cause prolonged UP states whereas deletion in inhibitory neurons has no effect. Excess signaling mediated by the group 1 glutamate metabotropic receptor, mGluR5, contributes to the longer UP states. Genetic reduction or pharmacological blockade of mGluR5 rescues the prolonged UP state phenotype. Our results reveal an alteration in network function in a mouse model of intellectual disability and autism which may impact both slow-wave sleep and information processing during waking states.        
21988366	Identification of expanded alleles of the FMR1 gene among high-risk population in Indonesia by using blood spot screening.          The prevalence of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is 1 in 4000 in males and 1 in 2500 in males and females, respectively, in the general population. Several screening studies aimed at determining the prevalence of FXS have been conducted in individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) with a prevalence varying from 1.15% to 6.3% across different ethnic groups. A previous study in Indonesia showed an FXS prevalence of 1.9% among the ID population. A rapid, effective, and inexpensive method for FMR1 screening, using dried blood spots capable of detecting an expanded FMR1 allele in both males and females, was recently reported. We used this approach to screen 176 blood spots, collected from Central Java, Indonesia, for the presence of expanded FMR1 gene alleles. Samples were collected from high-risk populations: 112 individuals with ID, 32 obtained from individuals with diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, and 32 individuals with a known family history of FXS. Fourteen subjects carrying an FMR1 expanded allele were identified including 7 premutations (55-200 CGG repeats) and 7 full mutations (>200 repeats). Of the seven subjects identified with a full mutation, one subject was from a non-fragile X family, and six from were families with a history of FXS.        
22001913	Increased prevalence of seizures in boys who were probands with the FMR1 premutation and co-morbid autism spectrum disorder.          Seizures are a common co-occurring condition in those with fragile X syndrome (FXS), and in those with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Seizures are also associated with ASD in those with FXS. However, little is known about the rate of seizures and how commonly these problems co-occur with ASD in boys with the FMR1 premutation. We, therefore, determined the prevalence of seizures and ASD in boys with the FMR1 premutation compared with their sibling counterparts and population prevalence estimates. Fifty premutation boys who presented as clinical probands (N = 25), or non-probands (identified by cascade testing after the proband was found) (N = 25), and 32 non-carrier controls were enrolled. History of seizures was documented and ASD was diagnosed by standardized measures followed by a team consensus of ASD diagnosis. Seizures (28%) and ASD (68%) were more prevalent in probands compared with non-probands (0 and 28%), controls (0 and 0%), and population estimates (1 and 1.7%). Seizures occurred more frequently in those with the premutation and co-morbid ASD particularly in probands compared with those with the premutation alone (25 vs. 3.85%, p = 0.045). Although cognitive and adaptive functioning in non-probands were similar to controls, non-probands were more likely to meet the diagnosis of ASD than controls (28 vs. 0%, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, seizures were relatively more common in premutation carriers who presented clinically as probands of the family and seizures were commonly associated with ASD in these boys. Therefore, boys with the premutation, particularly if they are probands should be assessed carefully for both ASD and seizures.        
30396281	Infant Temperament in the FMR1 Premutation and Fragile X Syndrome.          Although temperament has been studied for decades as a predictor of psychopathology in the general population, examining temperament in neurogenetic groups has unique potential to inform the genetic and biological factors that may confer risk for psychopathology in later development. The present study examined early temperament in two heritable neurogenetic conditions associated with atypical CGG repeat expansions on the FMR1 gene: the FMR1 premutation (FXpm; 55-200 repeats) and fragile X syndrome (FXS; > 200 repeats). We focus specifically on the FXpm, as the condition is highly prevalent (1:209-291 female individuals, 1:430-855 male individuals) and has been preliminarily associated with increased risk for pediatric psychopathology, including attention problems, autism, and anxiety. In contrast, FXS is a low-incidence disorder (1:7,143 males, 1:11,111 females) often associated with intellectual disability and severe co-occurring psychosocial conditions, particularly in male individuals. Given information on infant clinical phenotypes in the FXpm and FXS is sparse, we aimed to characterize parent-reported infant temperament in infants with the FXpm (n = 22) relative to FXS (n = 24) and controls (n = 24) assessed on 1 to 3 occasions each. Temperament in infants with the FXpm largely fell between TD and FXS groups, with trends toward suppressed negative affect in younger participants, similar to lower negative affect previously reported in FXS. The FXS group consistently demonstrated lower negative affect and surgency than TD controls. These data suggest that FMR1 gene mutations are associated with atypical temperament that emerges as early as infancy, particularly among infants with FXS, warranting further study of whether temperament may index emergent clinical risks in these populations.        
25705365	Antipurinergic therapy corrects the autism-like features in the Fragile X (Fmr1 knockout) mouse model.         Antipurinergic therapy (APT), Autism spectrum disorders, Cell danger response (CDR), Environment, Fragile X syndrome, Genetics, Maternal immune activation (MIA), Metabolism, Metabolomics, Mitochondria, Purinergic signaling This study was designed to test a new approach to drug treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the Fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mouse model.          
23200289	Evidence of a distinct behavioral phenotype in young boys with fragile X syndrome and autism.          How does the behavioral expression of autism in fragile X syndrome (FXS + Aut) compare with idiopathic autism (iAut)? Although social impairments and restricted, repetitive behaviors are common to these variants of autism, closer examination of these symptom domains may reveal meaningful similarities and differences. To this end, the specific behaviors comprising the social and repetitive behavioral domains in young children with FXS + Aut and iAut were profiled.          
25016041	Insights into GABAAergic system deficits in fragile X syndrome lead to clinical trials.         Fragile X syndrome, GABA(A) receptor, Gaboxadol, Ganaxolone, Targeted treatment An increasing number of studies implicate the GABAAergic system in the pathophysiology of the fragile X syndrome, a frequent cause of intellectual disability and autism. Animal models have proven invaluable in unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder. Multiple defects in this inhibitory system have been identified in Fmr1 knockout mice, including altered expression of various components, aberrant GABAA receptor-mediated signalling, altered GABA concentrations and anatomical defects in GABAergic neurons. Aberrations compatible with those described in the mouse model were detected in dfmr1 deficient Drosophila melanogaster, a validated fly model for the fragile X syndrome. Treatment with drugs that ameliorate the GABAAergic deficiency in both animal models have demonstrated that the GABAA receptor is a promising target for the treatment of fragile X patients. Based on these preclinical studies, clinical trials in patients have been initiated.          
9034011	Cognitive, behavioral, and neuroanatomical assessment of two unrelated male children expressing FRAXE.          Standardized cognitive, behavioral, and neuroanatomical data are presented on 2 unrelated boys with the FRAXE (FMR2) GCC expansion mutation. In the context of normal IQ, both boys had a history of developmental delay, including significant problems with communication, attention, and overactivity. Additionally, one child was diagnosed with autistic disorder. Data from these 2 cases are compared to analogous information from previous reports about individuals with the FRAXE or FRAXA (FMR1) mutation. These comparisons support the idea that FRAXE is associated with nonspecific developmental delay and possibly high-functioning autism.        
25055869	Polycomb group complexes are recruited to reactivated FMR1 alleles in Fragile X syndrome in response to FMR1 transcription.          The FMR1 gene is subject to repeat mediated-gene silencing when the CGG-repeat tract in the 5' UTR exceeds 200 repeat units. This results in Fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and a major cause of autism spectrum disorders. The mechanism of gene silencing is not fully understood, and efforts to reverse this gene silencing have had limited success. Here, we show that the level of trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27, a hallmark of the activity of EZH2, a component of repressive Polycomb Group (PcG) complexes like PRC2, is increased on reactivation of the silenced allele by either the DNA demethylating agent 5-azadeoxycytidine or the SIRT1 inhibitor splitomicin. The level of H3K27me3 increases and decreases in parallel with the FMR1 mRNA level. Furthermore, reducing the levels of the FMR1 mRNA reduces the accumulation of H3K27me3. This suggests a model for FMR1 gene silencing in which the FMR1 mRNA generated from the reactivated allele acts in cis to repress its own transcription via the recruitment of PcG complexes to the FMR1 locus.           
24660047	Pragmatic Language in autism and fragile X syndrome: Genetic and clinical applications.         Autism, Broad Autism Phenotype, FMR1 Premutation, Fragile X Syndrome, Pragmatic Language Evidence suggests a strong genetic basis to autism. Our research program focuses on identifying genetically meaningful phenotypes in autism, through family-genetic and cross-population methods, with a particular focus on language and social phenotypes that have been shown to aggregate in families of individuals with autism. In this article, we discuss recent findings from family study research implicating particular language and personality features as markers for genetic liability to autism and fragile X syndrome and         FMR1-related variation in relatives. We conclude with consideration of the clinical implications of such findings.
24664669	Autism and anxiety in males with fragile X syndrome: an exploratory analysis of neurobehavioral profiles from a parent survey.         anxiety, autism, fragile X, survey Although it is suspected that anxiety modifies the clinical presentation of autism in fragile X syndrome (FXS), neuropsychiatric co-morbidity profiles of these two disorders have not been extensively studied. The National Fragile X Survey was completed for 1,027 males with FXS, for whom yes/no information regarding the presence of several disorders is provided. Although the survey exhibited limited depth and lacked validation by standardized measures, this exploratory study was conducted to take advantage of the data as an opportunity for identifying future lines of inquiry. We addressed the following questions: (i) how do the co-morbidity profiles of FXS males with both autism and anxiety compare to those without anxiety?; (ii) do individuals with autism exhibit specific co-morbidity profiles compared to FXS males with anxiety only, or without either autism or anxiety?; (iii) how do co-morbidity profiles in children ages 3-11 differ from profiles of individuals >12 years? The group with autism and anxiety reported the highest prevalence of attention problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity, self-injurious behavior and aggressiveness. In addition, the lowest prevalence rates of these conditions were often observed in non-anxious groups regardless of autism status. Overall, this exploratory analysis generated several hypotheses for further study: (i) anxiety increases the severity of autism in FXS, particularly through additional behavioral abnormalities; (ii) some neuropsychiatric and behavioral conditions (i.e., attention problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity, aggressiveness) are primarily related to comorbid anxiety, not autism; (iii) prevalence of behavioral abnormalities increases with age. Future studies evaluating these hypotheses should incorporate validated neurobehavioral assessments, and control for cognitive level.          
24681195	Anxiety, hyperactivity and stereotypy in a zebrafish model of fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.         Anxiety, Autism spectrum disorder, Fragile X syndrome, Hyperactivity, Stereotypy, Zebrafish Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and is caused by a loss of function of the fragile X mental retardation (fmr1) gene. Animal fmr1-knockout (KO) models are not only of interest for the study of FXS, but have also important implications for our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we report the behavioral changes in fmr1-knockout zebrafish in an open field with two white and two transparent walls. The neophobic responses that in wild-type (WT) zebrafish normally occur during the first 5-10 min in an unfamiliar environment (such as freezing, hypo-activity and preferences for the bottom and opaque walls of the tank), were weakened in fmr1 mutants, suggesting a reduction of novelty-induced anxiety. The fmr1-KO zebrafish showed somewhat increased vertical activity beyond the 'neophobic phase', but no overall hyperactivity. The mutants demonstrated a clear habituation-independent preference for the transparent walls. Whether this was attributable to altered spatial information processing or to reduced avoidance of open spaces is discussed. Finally, since restrictive repetitive (or stereotypical) behaviors are frequently present in FXS and ASD patients, we analyzed relative turning angles, directional and preferential turning ratios and performed frequency-domain analysis. However, no indications of abnormal movement patterning were detected. The possible reasons for the absence of stereotypical behaviors are discussed in terms of behavioral endpoint selection and of eliciting conditions. Overall, our findings are consistent with those reported in fmr1-KO mice and suggest that further analysis of the fmr1-KO zebrafish model has potential to deepen our understanding of FXS and ASD.           
24684608	Extinction of an instrumental response: a cognitive behavioral assay in Fmr1 knockout mice.         Fragile X, instrumental extinction, intellectual disability, lovastatin, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 Fragile X (FX) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Previous studies have shown that partial inhibition of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling is sufficient to correct behavioral phenotypes in a mouse model of FX, including audiogenic seizures, open-field hyperactivity and social behavior. These phenotypes model well the epilepsy (15%), hyperactivity (20%) and autism (30%) that are comorbid with FX in human patients. Identifying reliable and robust mouse phenotypes to model cognitive impairments is critical considering the 90% comorbidity of FX and intellectual disability. Recent work characterized a five-choice visuospatial discrimination assay testing cognitive flexibility, in which FX model mice show impairments associated with decreases in synaptic proteins in prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, we sought to determine whether instrumental extinction, another process requiring PFC, is altered in FX model mice, and whether downregulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling pathways is sufficient to correct both visuospatial discrimination and extinction phenotypes. We report that instrumental extinction is consistently exaggerated in FX model mice. However, neither the extinction phenotype nor the visuospatial discrimination phenotype is corrected by approaches targeting metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling. This work describes a novel behavioral extinction assay to model impaired cognition in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, provides evidence that extinction is exaggerated in the FX mouse model and suggests possible limitations of metabotropic glutamate receptor-based pharmacotherapy.           
15655077	Cytogenetic abnormalities and fragile-X syndrome in Autism Spectrum Disorder.          Autism is a behavioral disorder with impaired social interaction, communication, and repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. About 5-10 % of individuals with autism have 'secondary' autism in which an environmental agent, chromosome abnormality, or single gene disorder can be identified. Ninety percent have idiopathic autism and a major gene has not yet been identified. We have assessed the incidence of chromosome abnormalities and Fragile X syndrome in a population of autistic patients referred to our laboratory.          
27001315	The long non-coding RNA FMR4 promotes proliferation of human neural precursor cells and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in trans.         Cellular proliferation, Chromatin modification, Epigenetics, Fragile X, Intellectual disability, Neurodevelopment, lncRNA Triplet repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause either intellectual disability and autism, or adult-onset neurodegeneration, with poorly understood variability in presentation. Previous studies have identified several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) at the FMR1 locus, including FMR4. Similarly to FMR1, FMR4 is silenced by large-repeat expansions that result in enrichment of DNA and histone methylation within the shared promoter and repeat sequence, suggesting a possible role for this noncoding RNA in the pathophysiology of Fragile X. We therefore assessed the functional role of FMR4 to gain further insight into the molecular processes in Fragile X-associated disorders. Previous work showed that FMR4 does not exhibit cis-regulation of FMR1. Here, we found that FMR4 is a chromatin-associated transcript and, using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, showed that FMR4 alters the chromatin state and the expression of several hundred genes in trans. Among the genes regulated by FMR4, we found enrichment for those involved in neural development and cellular proliferation. S-phase marker assays further demonstrated that FMR4 may promote cellular proliferation, rather than differentiation, of human neural precursor cells (hNPCs). By establishing this novel function for FMR4 in hNPCs, we lend support to existing evidence of the epigenetic involvement of lncRNA in nervous system development, and increase our understanding of the complex pathogenesis underlying neurological disorders associated with FMR1 repeat expansions.          
26933487	Synaptic vesicle dynamic changes in a model of fragile X.         Electron microscopy, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Mass spectrometry (MS), Quantitative live-cell imaging, Synaptic transmission Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder that is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and the most frequent monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). FXS is caused by an expansion of trinucleotide repeats in the promoter region of the fragile X mental retardation gene (Fmr1). This leads to a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which regulates translation of a wide range of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The extent of expression level alterations of synaptic proteins affected by FMRP loss and their consequences on synaptic dynamics in FXS has not been fully investigated.          
22224633	Validation of a screening tool for the rapid and reliable detection of CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in FMR1.          Most individuals with intellectual disability and/or autism are tested for Fragile X syndrome at some point in their lifetime. Greater than 99% of individuals with Fragile X have an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat motif in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene, and diagnostic testing involves determining the size of the CGG repeat as well as methylation status when an expansion is present.          
23867198	Advances in clinical and molecular understanding of the FMR1 premutation and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable form of cognitive impairment, is caused by epigenetic silencing of the fragile X (FMR1) gene owing to large expansions (>200 repeats) of a non-coding CGG-repeat element. Smaller, so-called premutation expansions (55-200 repeats) can cause a family of neurodevelopmental phenotypes (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, seizure disorder) and neurodegenerative (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]) phenotypes through an entirely distinct molecular mechanism involving increased FMR1 mRNA production and toxicity. Results of basic cellular, animal, and human studies have helped to elucidate the underlying RNA toxicity mechanism, while clinical research is providing a more nuanced picture of the range of clinical manifestations. Advances of knowledge on both mechanistic and clinical fronts are driving new approaches to targeted treatment, but two important necessities are emerging: to define the extent to which the mechanisms contributing to FXTAS also contribute to other neurodegenerative and medical disorders, and to redefine FXTAS in view of its differing presentations and associated features.           
24814569	Lithium: a promising treatment for fragile X syndrome.         FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, autism, dendritic spines, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), intellectual disability Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited disorder that results in intellectual disability and a characteristic behavioral profile that includes autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory hypersensitivity, hyperarousal, and anxiety. The epigenetic silencing of FMR1 and the consequent absence of its protein product, FMRP, is the most common cause of fragile X. The development of animal models of fragile X syndrome 20 years ago has produced a considerable increase in our understanding of the consequences of the absence of FMRP on the structure and function of the nervous system. Some of the insights gained have led to proposals of treatment strategies that are based on cellular and molecular changes observed in animals lacking FMRP. One such proposal is treatment with lithium, a drug with a long history of clinical efficacy in psychiatry and a drug with newly described uses in degenerative disorders of the nervous system. Lithium treatment has been studied extensively in both mouse and fruit fly models of FXS, and it has been shown to reverse numerous behavioral, physiological, cellular, and molecular phenotypes. A report of a pilot clinical trial on a limited number of adult FXS patients indicated that measurable improvements in behavior and function were seen after 2 months of lithium treatment. A double-blind clinical trial of lithium treatment in FXS patients is now needed.        
24817631	Intragenic rearrangements in X-linked intellectual deficiency: results of a-CGH in a series of 54 patients and identification of TRPC5 and KLHL15 as potential XLID genes.         KLHL15, TRPC5, X-linked intellectual disability, array CGH High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) enables the detection of intragenic rearrangements, such as single exon deletion or duplication. This approach can lead to the identification of new disease genes. We report on the analysis of 54 male patients presenting with intellectual deficiency (ID) and a family history suggesting X-linked (XL) inheritance or maternal skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), using a home-made X-chromosome-specific microarray covering the whole human X-chromosome at high resolution. The majority of patients had whole genome array-CGH prior to the selection and we did not include large rearrangements such as MECP2 and FMR1 duplications. We identified four rearrangements considered as causative or potentially pathogenic, corresponding to a detection rate of 8%. Two CNVs affected known XLID genes and were therefore considered as causative (IL1RAPL1 and OPHN1 intragenic deletions). Two new CNVs were considered as potentially pathogenic as they affected interesting candidates for ID. The first CNV is a deletion of the first exon of the TRPC5 gene, encoding a cation channel implicated in dendrite growth and patterning, in a child presenting with ID and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The second CNV is a partial deletion of KLHL15, in a patient with severe ID, epilepsy, and anomalies of cortical development. In both cases, in spite of strong arguments for clinical relevance, we were not able at this stage to confirm pathogenicity of the mutations, and the causality of the variants identified in XLID remains to be confirmed.          
21427756	Intermediate FMR1 alleles and cognitive and/or behavioural phenotypes.          During the last few years, several studies have reported an excess of intermediate FMR1 alleles in patients with cognitive and/or behavioural phenotypes. Here, we report the frequency of intermediate alleles (IAs) in three pathologies, intellectual disabilities (IDs), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism, from different Spanish regions. We found 142 IAs among 9015 patients with ID (1.6%), 4 among the 415 ADHD patients (0.96%) and 4 among the 300 autistic patients (1.3%), similar to the frequency reported in our control population. No evidence was found of an excess of IA at the FRAXA locus in any of the study populations, although geographical variability was detected. Moreover, the analysis of 100 transmissions of IAs showed that 95% of these alleles were stable. Only 3% expanded within the same range and 2% expanded to a full mutation in two generations. No evidence of an association between IAs and behavioural or cognitive phenotypes was found, suggesting that IAs are not clearly implicated in these pathologies.        
27754417	Molecular Correlates and Recent Advancements in the Diagnosis and Screening of FMR1-Related Disorders.         AGG interruption, CGG repeat, FMR1, FXPOI, FXTAS, fragile X syndrome, melting curve analysis, methylation, screening, triplet-primed PCR Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Molecular diagnostic testing of FXS and related disorders (fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)) relies on a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot (SB) for the fragile X mental retardation 1 (        FMR1) CGG-repeat expansion and methylation analyses. Recent advancements in PCR-based technologies have enabled the characterization of the complete spectrum of CGG-repeat mutation, with or without methylation assessment, and, as a result, have reduced our reliance on the labor- and time-intensive SB, which is the gold standard FXS diagnostic test. The newer and more robust triplet-primed PCR or TP-PCR assays allow the mapping of AGG interruptions and enable the predictive analysis of the risks of unstable CGG expansion during mother-to-child transmission. In this review, we have summarized the correlation between several molecular elements, including CGG-repeat size, methylation, mosaicism and skewed X-chromosome inactivation, and the extent of clinical involvement in patients with FMR1-related disorders, and reviewed key developments in PCR-based methodologies for the molecular diagnosis of FXS, FXTAS and FXPOI, and large-scale (CGG)n expansion screening in newborns, women of reproductive age and high-risk populations.
18165273	A rapid polymerase chain reaction-based screening method for identification of all expanded alleles of the fragile X (FMR1) gene in newborn and high-risk populations.          Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited cause of intellectual impairment and the most common single gene associated with autism, generally occurs for fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) alleles that exceed 200 CGG repeats (full-mutation range). Currently, there are no unbiased estimates of the number of full-mutation FMR1 alleles in the general population; a major obstacle is the lack of an effective screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles in large populations. We have developed a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles. The method utilizes a chimeric PCR primer that targets randomly within the expanded CGG region, such that the presence of a broad distribution of PCR products represents a positive result for an expanded allele. The method is applicable for screening both males and females and for allele sizes throughout the premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) and full-mutation ranges. Furthermore, the method is capable of rapid detection of expanded alleles using as little as 1% of the DNA from a single dried blood spot. The methodology presented in this work is suitable for screening large populations of newborn or those at high risk (eg, autism, premature ovarian failure, ataxia, dementia) for expanded FMR1 alleles. The test described herein costs less than $5 per sample for materials; with suitable scale-up and automation, the cost should approach $1 per sample.        
21893938	The psychiatric presentation of fragile x: evolution of the diagnosis and treatment of the psychiatric comorbidities of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders worldwide. It presents with a distinct behavioral phenotype which overlaps significantly with that of autism. Unlike autism and most common psychiatric disorders, the neurobiology of fragile X is relatively well understood. Lack of the fragile X mental retardation protein causes dysregulation of synaptically driven protein synthesis, which in turn causes global disruption of synaptic plasticity. Thus, FXS can be considered a disorder of synaptic plasticity, and a developmental disorder in the purest sense: mutation of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene results in abnormal synaptic development in response to experience. Accumulation of this abnormal synaptic development, over time, leads to a characteristic and surprisingly consistent behavioral phenotype of attention deficit, hyperactivity, impulsivity, multiple anxiety symptoms, repetitive/perseverative/stereotypic behaviors, unstable affect, aggression, and self-injurious behavior. Many features of the behavioral and psychiatric phenotype of FXS follow a developmental course, waxing and waning over the life span. In most cases, symptoms present as a mixed clinical picture, not fitting established diagnostic categories. There have been many clinical trials in fragile X subjects, but no placebo-controlled trials of adequate size or methodology utilizing the most commonly prescribed psychiatric medications. However, large and well-designed trials of investigational agents which target the underlying pathology of FXS have recently been completed or are under way. While the literature offers little guidance to the clinician treating patients with FXS today, potentially disease-modifying treatments may be available in the near future.          
21893949	What can we learn about autism from studying fragile X syndrome?          Despite early controversy, it is now accepted that a substantial proportion of children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) meets diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This change has led to an increased interest in studying the association of FXS and ASD because of the clinical consequences of their co-occurrence and the implications for a better understanding of ASD in the general population. Here, we review the current knowledge on the behavioral, neurobiological (i.e., neuroimaging), and molecular features of ASD in FXS, as well as the insight into ASD gained from mouse models of FXS. This review covers critical issues such as the selectivity of ASD in disorders associated with intellectual disability, differences between autistic features and ASD diagnosis, and the relationship between ASD and anxiety in FXS patients and animal models. While solid evidence supporting ASD in FXS as a distinctive entity is emerging, neurobiological and molecular data are still scarce. Animal model studies have not been particularly revealing about ASD in FXS either. Nevertheless, recent studies provide intriguing new leads and suggest that a better understanding of the bases of ASD will require the integration of multidisciplinary data from FXS and other genetic disorders.          
21901840	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 upregulation in children with autism is associated with underexpression of both Fragile X mental retardation protein and GABAA receptor beta 3 in adults with autism.          Recent work has demonstrated the impact of dysfunction of the GABAergic signaling system in brain and the resultant behavioral pathologies in subjects with autism. In animal models, altered expression of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) has been linked to downregulation of GABA receptors. Interestingly, the autistic phenotype is also observed in individuals with Fragile X syndrome. This study was undertaken to test previous theories relating abnormalities in levels of FMRP to GABA(A) receptor underexpression. We observed a significant reduction in levels of FMRP in the vermis of adults with autism. Additionally, we found that levels of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) protein were significantly increased in vermis of children with autism versus age and postmortem interval matched controls. There was also a significant decrease in level of GABA(A) receptor beta 3 (GABRβ3) protein in vermis of adult subjects with autism. Finally, we found significant increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein in vermis of both children and adults with autism when compared with controls. Taken together, our results provide further evidence that altered FMRP expression and increased mGluR5 protein production potentially lead to altered expression of GABA(A) receptors.          
19127654	Autism profiles of males with fragile X syndrome.          Autism, which is common in individuals with fragile X syndrome, is often difficult to diagnose. We compared the diagnostic classifications of two measures for autism diagnosis, the ADOS and the ADI-R, in addition to the DSM-IV-TR in 63 males with this syndrome. Overall, 30% of the subjects met criteria for autistic disorder and 30% met criteria for PDD-NOS. The classifications on the ADOS and DSM-IV-TR were most similar, whereas the ADI-R classified subjects as autistic much more frequently. We further investigated the relationship of both FMRP and FMRI mRNA to symptoms of autism in this cohort and found no significant relationship between the measures of autism and molecular features, including FMRP, FMRI mRNA, and CGG repeat number.        
19138667	Altered expression of Autism-associated genes in the brain of Fragile X mouse model.          Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, which typically emerges in early childhood. Most cases of autism have not been linked to mutations in a specific gene, and the etioloty of the disorder remains to be established [S.S. Moy, J.J. Nadler, T.R. Magnuson, J.N. Crawley, Mouse models of autism spectrum disorders: the challenge for behavioral genetics, Am. J. Med. Genet. 142 (2006) 40-51]. Fragile X syndrome is caused by mutation in the FMR1 gene and is characterized by mental retardation, physical abnormalities, and, in most case, autistic-like behavior [R.J. Hagerman, A.W. Jackson, A. Levitas, B. Rimland, M. Braden, An analysis of autism in fifty males with the Fragile X syndrome, Am. J. Med. Genet. 23 (1986) 359-374, C.E. Bakker, C. Verheij, R. Willemsen, R. van der Helm, F. Oerlemans, M. Vermeij, A. Bygrave, A.T. Hoogeveen, B.A. Oostra, E. Reyniers, K. De Boulle, R. D'Hooge, P. Cras, D. van Velzen, G. Nagels, J.J. Marti, P. De Deyn, J.K. Darby, P.J. Willems, Fmr1 knockout mice: a model to study Fragile X mental retardation, Cell 78 (1994) 23-33]. The FMR1 knockout (KO) mouse is one of the best characterized animal models for human disorders associated with autism [S.S. Moy, J.J. Nadler, T.R. Magnuson, J.N. Crawley, Mouse models of autism spectrum disorders: the challenge for behavioral genetics, Am. J. Med. Genet. 142 (2006) 40-51]. We have used real-time PCR to investigate changes in expression levels of three genes: WNT2, MECP2, and FMR1 in different brain regions of Fagile X mice and litter mate controls. We found major changes in the expression pattern for the three genes examined. FMR1, MECP2, and WNT2 expression were drastically down regulated in the Fragile X mouse brain.        
27089882	Altered Bioenergetics in Primary Dermal Fibroblasts from Adult Carriers of the FMR1 Premutation Before the Onset of the Neurodegenerative Disease Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome.         Autism, Endophenotyes, Fragile X, Mitochondria, Mitochondrial network, Neurodegeneration, Premutation, Triplet nucleotide diseases Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by tremors, ataxia, impaired coordination, and cognitive decline. While all FXTAS individuals are carriers of a 55-200 CGG expansion at the 5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1), also known as premutation, not all carriers develop FXTAS symptoms and some display other types of psychological/emotional disorders (e.g., autism, anxiety). The goal of this study was to investigate whether the mitochondrial dysfunction previously observed in fibroblasts from older premutation individuals (>60 years) was already present in younger (17-48 years), non-FXTAS-affected carriers and to identify the type and severity of the bioenergetic deficit. Since FXTAS affects mostly males, while females account for a small part of the FXTAS-affected population displaying less severe symptoms, only fibroblasts from males were evaluated in this study. Based on polarographic and enzymatic measurements, a generalized OXPHOS deficit was noted accompanied by increases in the matrix biomarker citrate synthase, oxidative stress (as increased mtDNA copy number and deletions), and mitochondrial network disruption/disorganization. Some of the outcomes (ATP-linked oxygen uptake, coupling, citrate synthase activity, and mitochondrial network organization) strongly correlated with the extent of the CGG expansion, with more severe deficits observed in cell lines carrying higher CGG number. Furthermore, mitochondrial outcomes can identify endophenotypes among carriers and are robust predictors of the premutation diagnosis before the onset of FXTAS, with the potential to be used as markers of prognosis and/or as readouts of pharmacological interventions.        
27090306	Insulin signaling misregulation underlies circadian and cognitive deficits in a Drosophila fragile X model.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an undertreated neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by low intelligence quotent and a wide range of other symptoms including disordered sleep and autism. Although FXS is the most prevalent inherited cause of intellectual disability, its mechanistic underpinnings are not well understood. Using Drosophila as a model of FXS, we showed that select expression of dfmr1 in the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) of the brain was sufficient to restore normal circadian behavior and to rescue the memory deficits in the fragile X mutant fly. Examination of the insulin signaling (IS) pathway revealed elevated levels of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (Dilp2) in the IPCs and elevated IS in the dfmr1 mutant brain. Consistent with a causal role for elevated IS in dfmr1 mutant phenotypes, the expression of dfmr1 specifically in the IPCs reduced IS, and genetic reduction of the insulin pathway also led to amelioration of circadian and memory defects. Furthermore, we showed that treatment with the FDA-approved drug metformin also rescued memory. Finally, we showed that reduction of IS is required at different time points to rescue circadian behavior and memory. Our results indicate that insulin misregulation underlies the circadian and cognitive phenotypes displayed by the Drosophila fragile X model, and thus reveal a metabolic pathway that can be targeted by new and already approved drugs to treat fragile X patients.        
27102723	Social anxiety and autism spectrum traits among adult FMR1 premutation carriers.         FMR1 premutation, FXTAS, autism, autistic traits, social anxiety, social phobia Behavioral symptoms and traits have been proposed as early markers in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate social anxiety and autism in FMR1 premutation carriers using the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) and the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaires. Fifty-nine premutation carriers were compared with 50 controls. The SPIN test showed statistically significant differences between female but not male carriers. The AQ questionnaire found statistically significant differences between premutation carriers and controls in the total AQ as well as in the social skills and attention switching subdomains. A gender effect was only observed for the social skills subdomain. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a moderately positive correlation with the total AQ scores as well as the social skills and communication subdomains. Our results show that fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) patients have higher AQ scores. Moreover, this is the first study to find statistically significant differences between FXTAS and no-FXTAS premutation carriers in the communication and the imagination subdomains, suggesting that FXTAS patients present a broader autistic phenotype than premutation carriers without FXTAS. Based on our results, a wide range of behavioral/psychiatric traits should be included within the broader phenotypic presentation of individuals with the FMR1 premutation.          
28649315	Effects of a social stimulus on gene expression in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.         Amygdala, Autism spectrum disorder, Fragile X syndrome, Prefrontal cortex, RNA sequencing, Social behavior People with fragile X syndrome (FXS) often have deficits in social behavior, and a substantial portion meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Though the genetic cause of FXS is known to be due to the silencing of           FMR1, and the Fmr1 null mouse model representing this lesion has been extensively studied, the contributions of this gene and its protein product, FMRP, to social behavior are not well understood.
28660769	Platelets as a surrogate disease model of neurodevelopmental disorders: Insights from Fragile X Syndrome.         Autism spectrum disorder, ERK, Fragile X Syndrome, biomarkers, intellectual disability, platelets Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Despite a large number of therapeutics developed in past years, there is currently no targeted treatment approved for FXS. In fact, translation of the positive and very promising preclinical findings from animal models to human subjects has so far fallen short owing in part to the low predictive validity of the Fmr1 ko mouse, an overly simplistic model of the complex human disease. This issue stresses the critical need to identify new surrogate human peripheral cell models of FXS, which may in fact allow for the identification of novel and more efficient therapies. Of all described models, blood platelets appear to be one of the most promising and appropriate disease models of FXS, in part owing to their close biochemical similarities with neurons. Noteworthy, they also recapitulate some of FXS neuron's core molecular dysregulations, such as hyperactivity of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, elevated enzymatic activity of MMP9 and decreased production of cAMP. Platelets might therefore help furthering our understanding of FXS pathophysiology and might also lead to the identification of disease-specific biomarkers, as was shown in several psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, there is additional evidence suggesting that platelet signaling may assist with prediction of cognitive phenotype and could represent a potent readout of drug efficacy in clinical trials. Globally, given the neurobiological overlap between different forms of intellectual disability, platelets may be a valuable window to access the molecular underpinnings of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) sharing similar synaptic plasticity defects with FXS. Platelets are indeed an attractive model for unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms involved in NDD as well as to search for diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.        
28674175	Enhanced Excitatory Connectivity and Disturbed Sound Processing in the Auditory Brainstem of Fragile X Mice.         Fragile X, auditory, brainstem, excitatory synapses, lateral superior olive, sound level Hypersensitivity to sounds is one of the prevalent symptoms in individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It manifests behaviorally early during development and is often used as a landmark for treatment efficacy. However, the physiological mechanisms and circuit-level alterations underlying this aberrant behavior remain poorly understood. Using the mouse model of FXS (          Fmr1 KO), we demonstrate that functional maturation of auditory brainstem synapses is impaired in FXS. Fmr1 KO mice showed a greatly enhanced excitatory synaptic input strength in neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO), a prominent auditory brainstem nucleus, which integrates ipsilateral excitation and contralateral inhibition to compute interaural level differences. Conversely, the glycinergic, inhibitory input properties remained unaffected. The enhanced excitation was the result of an increased number of cochlear nucleus fibers converging onto one LSO neuron, without changing individual synapse properties. Concomitantly, immunolabeling of excitatory ending markers revealed an increase in the immunolabeled area, supporting abnormally elevated excitatory input numbers. Intrinsic firing properties were only slightly enhanced. In line with the disturbed development of LSO circuitry, auditory processing was also affected in adult Fmr1 KO mice as shown with single-unit recordings of LSO neurons. These processing deficits manifested as an increase in firing rate, a broadening of the frequency response area, and a shift in the interaural level difference function of LSO neurons. Our results suggest that this aberrant synaptic development of auditory brainstem circuits might be a major underlying cause of the auditory processing deficits in FXS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inheritable form of intellectual impairment, including autism. A core symptom of FXS is extreme sensitivity to loud sounds. This is one reason why individuals with FXS tend to avoid social interactions, contributing to their isolation. Here, a mouse model of FXS was used to investigate the auditory brainstem where basic sound information is first processed. Loss of the Fragile X mental retardation protein leads to excessive excitatory compared with inhibitory inputs in neurons extracting information about sound levels. Functionally, this elevated excitation results in increased firing rates, and abnormal coding of frequency and binaural sound localization cues. Imbalanced early-stage sound level processing could partially explain the auditory processing deficits in FXS.
30483160	Fragile X-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND).         FMR1 premutation, FXAND, FXPOI, FXTAS, fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the full mutation (>200 CGG repeats) in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (        FMR1) gene. It is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability (ID) and autism. This review focuses on neuropsychiatric disorders frequently experienced by premutation carriers with 55 to 200 CGG repeats and the pathophysiology involves elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, which is different from the absence or deficiency of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) seen in FXS. Neuropsychiatric disorders are the most common problems associated with the premutation, and they affect approximately 50% of individuals with 55 to 200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Neuropsychiatric disorders in children with the premutation include anxiety, ADHD, social deficits, or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In adults with the premutation, anxiety and depression are the most common problems, although obsessive compulsive disorder, ADHD, and substance abuse are also common. These problems are often exacerbated by chronic fatigue, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, autoimmune disorders and sleep problems, which are also associated with the premutation. Here we review the clinical studies, neuropathology and molecular underpinnings of RNA toxicity associated with the premutation. We also propose the name Fragile X-associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND) in an effort to promote research and the use of fragile X DNA testing to enhance recognition and treatment for these disorders.
29704597	Modelling fragile X syndrome in the laboratory setting: A behavioral perspective.         Animal models, Behavior, Behavioral phenotyping, Fmr1-KO, Fragile X syndrome Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most frequent monogenic cause of syndromic autism spectrum disorders. The syndrome is caused by the loss of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a key RNA-binding protein involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology. Patients show intellectual disability, social deficits, repetitive behaviors and impairments in social communication. The aim of this review is to outline the importance of behavioral phenotyping of animal models of FXS from a developmental perspective, by showing how the behavioral characteristics of FXS at the clinical level can be translated into effective, developmentally-specific and clinically meaningful behavioral readouts in the laboratory setting. After introducing the behavioral features, diagnostic criteria and off-label pharmacotherapy of FXS, we outline how FXS-relevant behavioral features can be modelled in laboratory animals in the course of development: we review the progress to date, discuss how behavioral phenotyping in animal models of FXS is essential to identify potential treatments, and discuss caveats and future directions in this research field.          
29713264	Modeling Fragile X Syndrome in         Drosophila. Drosophila, FMR1, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, Fragile X Syndrome, behavior, dFRM1, mushroom bodies, neuromuscular junction Intellectual disability (ID) and autism are hallmarks of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a hereditary neurodevelopmental disorder. The gene responsible for FXS is Fragile X Mental Retardation gene 1 (        FMR1) encoding the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in RNA metabolism and modulating the expression level of many targets. Most cases of FXS are caused by silencing of FMR1 due to CGG expansions in the 5'-UTR of the gene. Humans also carry the FXR1 and FXR2 paralogs of FMR1 while flies have only one FMR1 gene, here called dFMR1, sharing the same level of sequence homology with all three human genes, but functionally most similar to FMR1. This enables a much easier approach for FMR1 genetic studies. Drosophila has been widely used to investigate FMR1 functions at genetic, cellular, and molecular levels since dFMR1 mutants have many phenotypes in common with the wide spectrum of FMR1 functions that underlay the disease. In this review, we present very recent Drosophila studies investigating FMRP functions at genetic, cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological levels in addition to research on pharmacological treatments in the fly model. These studies have the potential to aid the discovery of pharmacological therapies for FXS.
16700053	Autistic behavior in children with fragile X syndrome: prevalence, stability, and the impact of FMRP.          We examined autistic behavior in a cross-sectional sample of 179 children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) and a longitudinal subset of 116 children using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) to (a) determine a prevalence of autistic behavior in FXS, (b) examine the stability of autistic ratings over time, and (c) assess the association between the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and autistic behavior. Approximately 21% of the sample of 129 children (25.9% of boys) scored at or above the cutoff for autism. CARS scores increased slowly, yet significantly, over time, and low levels of FMRP were associated with higher mean levels of autistic behavior as measured by the CARS.        
29398931	Syndromic autism spectrum disorders: moving from a clinically defined to a molecularly defined approach.         ASD-risk gene, autism spectrum disorder, copy number variant, microarray, syndromic, whole exome sequencing Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a group of neurodevelopmental conditions diagnosed solely on the basis of behavioral assessments that reveal social deficits. Progress has been made in understanding its genetic underpinnings, but most ASD-associated genetic variants, which include copy number variants (CNVs) and mutations in ASD-risk genes, account for no more than 1 % of ASD cases. This high level of genetic heterogeneity leads to challenges obtaining and interpreting genetic testing in clinical settings. The traditional definition of syndromic ASD is a disorder with a clinically defined pattern of somatic abnormalities and a neurobehavioral phenotype that may include ASD. Most have a known genetic cause. Examples include fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex. We propose dividing syndromic autism into the following two groups: (i) ASD that occurs in the context of a clinically defined syndrome-recognizing these disorders depends on the familiarity of the clinician with the features of the syndrome, and the diagnosis is typically confirmed by targeted genetic testing (eg, mutation screening of FMR1); (ii) ASD that occurs as a feature of a molecularly defined syndrome-for this group of patients, ASD-associated variants are identified by genome-wide testing that is not hypothesis driven (eg, microarray, whole exome sequencing). These ASD groups cannot be easily clinically defined because patients with a given variant have variable somatic abnormalities (dysmorphism and birth defects). In this article, we review common diagnoses from the above categories and suggest a testing strategy for patients, guided by determining whether the individual has essential or complex ASD; patients in the latter group have multiple morphologic anomalies on physical examination. Finally, we recommend that the syndromic versus nonsyndromic designation ultimately be replaced by classification of ASD according to its genetic etiology, which will inform about the associated spectrum and penetrance of neurobehavioral and somatic manifestations.        
28137726	Molecular analyses of neurogenic defects in a human pluripotent stem cell model of fragile X syndrome.         autism spectrum disorder, brain development, fragile X syndrome, neurogenesis, stem cells New research suggests that common pathways are altered in many neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder; however, little is known about early molecular events that contribute to the pathology of these diseases. The study of monogenic, neurodevelopmental disorders with a high incidence of autistic behaviours, such as fragile X syndrome, has the potential to identify genes and pathways that are dysregulated in autism spectrum disorder as well as fragile X syndrome. In vitro generation of human disease-relevant cell types provides the ability to investigate aspects of disease that are impossible to study in patients or animal models. Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells recapitulates development of the neocortex, an area affected in both fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. We have generated induced human pluripotent stem cells from several individuals clinically diagnosed with fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. When differentiated to dorsal forebrain cell fates, our fragile X syndrome human pluripotent stem cell lines exhibited reproducible aberrant neurogenic phenotypes. Using global gene expression and DNA methylation profiling, we have analysed the early stages of neurogenesis in fragile X syndrome human pluripotent stem cells. We discovered aberrant DNA methylation patterns at specific genomic regions in fragile X syndrome cells, and identified dysregulated gene- and network-level correlates of fragile X syndrome that are associated with developmental signalling, cell migration, and neuronal maturation. Integration of our gene expression and epigenetic analysis identified altered epigenetic-mediated transcriptional regulation of a distinct set of genes in fragile X syndrome. These fragile X syndrome-aberrant networks are significantly enriched for genes associated with autism spectrum disorder, giving support to the idea that underlying similarities exist among these neurodevelopmental diseases.          
25820841	R-Baclofen Reverses a Social Behavior Deficit and Elevated Protein Synthesis in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.         Fragile X syndrome, R-baclofen, mTOR, protein synthesis, social behavior Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common known inherited form of intellectual disability and the single genomic cause of autism spectrum disorders. It is caused by the absence of a fragile X mental retardation gene (Fmr1) product, FMRP, an RNA-binding translation suppressor. Elevated rates of protein synthesis in the brain and an imbalance between synaptic signaling via glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are both considered important in the pathogenesis of FXS. In a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1 knockout [KO]), treatment with R-baclofen reversed some behavioral and biochemical phenotypes. A remaining crucial question is whether R-baclofen is also able to reverse increased brain protein synthesis rates.          
21490592	Gender-specific effect of Mthfr genotype and neonatal vigabatrin interaction on synaptic proteins in mouse cortex.          The enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a part of the homocysteine and folate metabolic pathways, affecting the methylations of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Mthfr deficiency was reported as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Neonatal disruption of the GABAergic system is also associated with behavioral outcomes. The interaction between the epigenetic influence of Mthfr deficiency and neonatal exposure to the GABA potentiating drug vigabatrin (GVG) in mice has been shown to have gender-dependent effects on mice anxiety and to have memory impairment effects in a gender-independent manner. Here we show that Mthfr deficiency interacts with neonatal GABA potentiation to alter social behavior in female, but not male, mice. This impairment was associated with a gender-dependent enhancement of proteins implicated in excitatory synapse plasticity in the female cortex. Reelin and fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP) levels and membrane GluR1/GluR2 ratios were elevated in wild-type mice treated neonatally with GVG and in Mthfr+/- mice treated with saline, but not in Mthfr+/- mice treated with GVG, compared with control groups (wild type treated with saline). A minor influence on the levels of these proteins was observed in male mice cortices, possibly due to high basal protein levels. Interaction between gender, genotype, and treatment was also observed in the GABA pathway. In female mice, GABA Aα2/gephyrin ratios were suppressed in all test groups; in male mice, a genotype-specific enhancement of GABA Aα2/gephyrin was observed. The lack of an effect on either reln or Fmr1 transcription suggests post-transcriptional regulation of these genes. Taken together, these findings suggest that Mthfr deficiency may interact with neonatal GABA potentiation in a gender-dependent manner to interrupt synaptic function. This may illustrate a possible mechanism for the epigenetic involvement of Mthfr deficiency in neurodevelopmental disorders.        
24173622	The challenges of clinical trials in fragile X syndrome.          Advances in understanding the underlying mechanisms of conditions such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorders have revealed heterogeneous populations. Recent trials of novel FXS therapies have highlighted several challenges including subpopulations with possibly differential therapeutic responses, the lack of specific outcome measures capturing the full range of improvements of patients with FXS, and a lack of biomarkers that can track whether a specific mechanism is responsive to a new drug and whether the response correlates with clinical improvement.          
25674387	Fragile X syndrome as a rare disease in China - Therapeutic challenges and opportunities.         Drug development, FMR1, Fragile X syndrome, Translational science, mGluR5 Recognized as the most common inherited from of intellectual disability (ID) and the most common known monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is identified as an unmet medical need for the development of personalized medicine and targeted therapeutics for neurodevelopment disorders as a result of improved understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms. Consequently promising pharmacological targets have emerged from basic and translational research, are now being pursued by global pharmaceutical and biotech companies in early proof-of-concept clinical trials. With the world's largest rare disease population, China potentially has a large number of FXS patients, many of whom are under-diagnosed or even misdiagnosed, barely with any treatment. In spite of improved awareness of FXS in recent years, big gaps still exist between China and developed countries in multiple aspects. With increased public awareness, strong government support and investment, coupled with an increasingly large number of Western-trained experienced researchers engaging in new drug discovery and development, China has the potential to become an important player in the discovery of effective diagnostics and treatments for a rare disease like FXS.         
25679778	Deletion of Fmr1 alters function and synaptic inputs in the auditory brainstem.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a neurodevelopmental disorder, is the most prevalent single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder. Autism has been associated with impaired auditory processing, abnormalities in the auditory brainstem response (ABR), and reduced cell number and size in the auditory brainstem nuclei. FXS is characterized by elevated cortical responses to sound stimuli, with some evidence for aberrant ABRs. Here, we assessed ABRs and auditory brainstem anatomy in Fmr1-/- mice, an animal model of FXS. We found that Fmr1-/- mice showed elevated response thresholds to both click and tone stimuli. Amplitudes of ABR responses were reduced in Fmr1-/- mice for early peaks of the ABR. The growth of the peak I response with sound intensity was less steep in mutants that in wild type mice. In contrast, amplitudes and response growth in peaks IV and V did not differ between these groups. We did not observe differences in peak latencies or in interpeak latencies. Cell size was reduced in Fmr1-/- mice in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We quantified levels of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in these nuclei using markers for presynaptic proteins. We measured VGAT and VGLUT immunolabeling in VCN, MNTB, and the lateral superior olive (LSO). VGAT expression in MNTB was significantly greater in the Fmr1-/- mouse than in wild type mice. Together, these observations demonstrate that FXS affects peripheral and central aspects of hearing and alters the balance of excitation and inhibition in the auditory brainstem.         
21220020	A mouse model of the fragile X premutation: effects on behavior, dendrite morphology, and regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis.          Carriers of FMR1 premutation alleles have 55-200 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the gene. These individuals are at risk for fragile X associated primary ovarian insufficiency (females) and, in late life, fragile X associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (males, and to a lesser extent, females). Premutation carrier status can also be associated with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and some cognitive deficits. In premutation carriers, FMR1 mRNA levels are often higher than those with normal sized alleles. In contrast, in subjects with full mutation alleles, (>200 repeats) the FMR1 gene is silenced and FMR1 mRNA and its product, FMRP, are absent. We have studied a male knock-in (KI) mouse model of the fragile X premutation (120-140 repeats) during young adulthood. In comparison to wild type, KI mice were hyperactive, exhibited less anxiety in both the open field and the elevated zero maze, were impaired on the passive avoidance test, and showed some subtle deficits on a test of social interaction. Motor learning as assessed by the rotarod test was normal. Dendritic arbors were less complex and spine densities and lengths increased in medial prefrontal cortex, basal lateral amygdala, and hippocampus compared with wild type. Regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis measured in vivo in KI mice were increased. KI mice also had elevated levels of Fmr1 mRNA and decreased levels of FMRP. Our results highlight similarities in phenotype between KI and Fmr1 knockout mice and suggest that the decreased concentration of FMRP contributes to the phenotype in young adult KI mice.          
22483044	The pathophysiology of fragile X (and what it teaches us about synapses).          Fragile X is the most common known inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism, and it typically results from transcriptional silencing of FMR1 and loss of the encoded protein, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein). FMRP is an mRNA-binding protein that functions at many synapses to inhibit local translation stimulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) 1 and 5. Recent studies on the biology of FMRP and the signaling pathways downstream of mGluR1/5 have yielded deeper insight into how synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity are regulated by experience. This new knowledge has also suggested ways that altered signaling and synaptic function can be corrected in fragile X, and human clinical trials based on this information are under way.        
22483378	Fragile X syndrome: mechanistic insights and therapeutic avenues regarding the role of potassium channels.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of mental disability and one of the known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of the trinucleotide CGG repeats that leads to DNA methylation of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1) and transcriptional silencing, resulting in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA binding protein. Although it is widely known that FMRP is critical for metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD), which has provided a general theme for developing pharmacological drugs for FXS, specific downstream targets of FMRP may also be of therapeutic value. Since alterations in potassium channel expression level or activity could underlie neuronal network defects in FXS, here we describe recent findings on how these channels might be altered in mouse models of FXS and the possible therapeutic avenues for treating FXS.          
19799873	Lithium ameliorates altered glycogen synthase kinase-3 and behavior in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited mental retardation and a genetic cause of autism, results from mutated fragile X mental retardation-1 (Fmr1). This study examined the effects on glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) of treatment with a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist, MPEP, and the GSK3 inhibitor, lithium, in C57Bl/6 Fmr1 knockout mice. Increased mGluR signaling may contribute to the pathology of FXS, and the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP increased inhibitory serine-phosphorylation of brain GSK3 selectively in Fmr1 knockout mice but not in wild-type mice. Inhibitory serine-phosphorylation of GSK3 was lower in Fmr1 knockout, than wild-type, mouse brain regions and was increased by acute or chronic lithium treatment, which also increased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Fmr1 knockout mice displayed alterations in open-field activity, elevated plus-maze, and passive avoidance, and these differences were ameliorated by chronic lithium treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that impaired inhibition of GSK3 contributes to the pathogenesis of FXS and support GSK3 as a potential therapeutic target.        
24207117	"The roles of FMRP-regulated genes in autism spectrum disorder: single- and multiple-hit genetic etiologies.          Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Although roles for both de novo and familial genetic variation have been documented, the underlying disease mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. In this study, we defined and explored distinct etiologies of genetic variants that affect genes regulated by Fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP), thought to play a key role in neuroplasticity and neuronal translation, in ASD-affected individuals. In particular, we developed the Trend test, a pathway-association test that is able to robustly detect multiple-hit etiologies and is more powerful than existing approaches. Exploiting detailed spatiotemporal maps of gene expression within the human brain, we identified four discrete FMRP-target subpopulations that exhibit distinct functional biases and contribute to ASD via different types of genetic variation. We also demonstrated that FMRP target genes are more likely than other genes with similar expression patterns to contribute to disease. We developed the hypothesis that FMRP targets contribute to ASD via two distinct etiologies: (1) ultra-rare and highly penetrant single disruptions of embryonically upregulated FMRP targets (""single-hit etiology"") or (2) the combination of multiple less penetrant disruptions of nonembryonic, synaptic FMRP targets (""multiple-hit etiology""). The Trend test provides rigorous support for a multiple-hit genetic etiology in a subset of autism cases and is easily extendible to combining information from multiple types of genetic variation (i.e., copy-number and exome variants), increasing its value to next-generation sequencing approaches.           "
20032969	Repetitive self-grooming behavior in the BTBR mouse model of autism is blocked by the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP.          Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by abnormal reciprocal social interactions, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors with restricted interests. BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) is an inbred mouse strain that shows robust behavioral phenotypes with analogies to all three of the diagnostic symptoms of autism, including well-replicated deficits in reciprocal social interactions and social approach, unusual patterns of ultrasonic vocalization, and high levels of repetitive self-grooming. These phenotypes offer straightforward behavioral assays for translational investigations of pharmacological compounds. Two suggested treatments for autism were evaluated in the BTBR mouse model. Methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP), an antagonist of the mGluR5 metabotropic glutamate receptor, blocks aberrant phenotypes in the Fmr1 mouse model of Fragile X, a comorbid neurodevelopmental disorder with autistic features. Risperidone has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of irritability, tantrums, and self-injurious behavior in autistic individuals. We evaluated the actions of MPEP and risperidone on two BTBR phenotypes, low sociability and high repetitive self-grooming. Open field activity served as an independent control for non-social exploratory activity and motor functions. C57BL/6J (B6), an inbred strain with high sociability and low self-grooming, served as the strain control. MPEP significantly reduced repetitive self-grooming in BTBR, at doses that had no sedating effects on open field activity. Risperidone reduced repetitive self-grooming in BTBR, but only at doses that induced sedation in both strains. No overall improvements in sociability were detected in BTBR after treatment with either MPEP or risperidone. Our findings suggest that antagonists of mGluR5 receptors may have selective therapeutic efficacy in treating repetitive behaviors in autism.        
29970983	Common Defects of Spine Dynamics and Circuit Function in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Systematic Review of Findings From         in Vivo Optical Imaging of Mouse Models. autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), calcium imaging, dendritic spines, excitatory-inhibitory balance, serotonin, two-photon imaging In vivo optical imaging is a powerful tool for revealing brain structure and function at both the circuit and cellular levels. Here, we provide a systematic review of findings obtained from in vivo imaging studies of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, including the monogenic disorders fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome, which are caused by genetic abnormalities of FMR1, MECP2, and UBE3A, as well as disorders caused by copy number variations (15q11-13 duplication and 22q11.2 deletion) and BTBR mice as an inbred strain model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most studies visualize the structural and functional responsiveness of cerebral cortical neurons to sensory stimuli and the developmental and experience-dependent changes in these responses as a model of brain functions affected by these disorders. The optical imaging techniques include two-photon microscopy of fluorescently labeled dendritic spines or neurons loaded with fluorescent calcium indicators and macroscopic imaging of cortical activity using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes or intrinsic optical signals. Studies have revealed alterations in the density, stability, and turnover of dendritic spines, aberrant cortical sensory responses, impaired inhibitory function, and concomitant failure of circuit maturation as common causes for neurological deficits. Mechanistic hypotheses derived from in vivo imaging also provide new directions for therapeutic interventions. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that early postnatal administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) restores impaired cortical inhibitory function and ameliorates the aberrant social behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. We discuss the potential use of SSRIs for treating ASDs in light of these findings.
29984470	Imaging genetics in neurodevelopmental psychopathology.         ADHD, ASD, ID, brain imaging genetics, neurodevelopmental disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders are defined by highly heritable problems during development and brain growth. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and intellectual disability (ID) are frequent neurodevelopmental disorders, with common comorbidity among them. Imaging genetics studies on the role of disease-linked genetic variants on brain structure and function have been performed to unravel the etiology of these disorders. Here, we reviewed imaging genetics literature on these disorders attempting to understand the mechanisms of individual disorders and their clinical overlap. For ADHD and ASD, we selected replicated candidate genes implicated through common genetic variants. For ID, which is mainly caused by rare variants, we included genes for relatively frequent forms of ID occurring comorbid with ADHD or ASD. We reviewed case-control studies and studies of risk variants in healthy individuals. Imaging genetics studies for ADHD were retrieved for SLC6A3/DAT1, DRD2, DRD4, NOS1, and SLC6A4/5HTT. For ASD, studies on CNTNAP2, MET, OXTR, and SLC6A4/5HTT were found. For ID, we reviewed the genes FMR1, TSC1 and TSC2, NF1, and MECP2. Alterations in brain volume, activity, and connectivity were observed. Several findings were consistent across studies, implicating, for example, SLC6A4/5HTT in brain activation and functional connectivity related to emotion regulation. However, many studies had small sample sizes, and hypothesis-based, brain region-specific studies were common. Results from available studies confirm that imaging genetics can provide insight into the link between genes, disease-related behavior, and the brain. However, the field is still in its early stages, and conclusions about shared mechanisms cannot yet be drawn.          
28955201	Fragile X-Associated Diminished Ovarian Reserve and Primary Ovarian Insufficiency from Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Manifestations.         FMR1 premutation carriers, diminished ovarian reserve, fragile X syndrome, fragile-X-associated diminished ovarian reserve, fragile-X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency Fragile X syndrome (FXS), is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the         FMR1 gene located on the X-chromosome, which leads to the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability in males and the leading single-gene defect associated with autism. A full mutation (FM) is represented by more than 200 CGG repeats within the FMR1 gene, resulting in FXS. A FM is inherited from women carrying a FM or a premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG repeats) allele. PM is associated with phenotypes distinct from those associated with FM. Some manifestations of the PM are unique; fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile-X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), while others tend to be non-specific such as intellectual disability. In addition, women carrying a PM may suffer from subfertility or infertility. There is a need to elucidate whether the impairment of ovarian function found in PM carriers arises during the primordial germ cell (PGC) development stage, or due to a rapidly diminishing oocyte pool throughout life or even both. Due to the possibility of expansion into a FM in the next generation, and other ramifications, carrying a PM can have an enormous impact on one's life; therefore, preconception counseling for couples carrying the PM is of paramount importance. In this review, we will elaborate on the clinical manifestations in female PM carriers and propose the definition of fragile-X-associated diminished ovarian reserve (FXDOR), then we will review recent scientific findings regarding possible mechanisms leading to FXDOR and FXPOI. Lastly, we will discuss counseling, preventative measures and interventions available for women carrying a PM regarding different aspects of their reproductive life, fertility treatment, pregnancy, prenatal testing, contraception and fertility preservation options.
28960184	Fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited form of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, and patients can present with severe behavioural alterations, including hyperactivity, impulsivity and anxiety, in addition to poor language development and seizures. FXS is a trinucleotide repeat disorder, in which >200 repeats of the CGG motif in FMR1 leads to silencing of the gene and the consequent loss of its product, fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP). FMRP has a central role in gene expression and regulates the translation of potentially hundreds of mRNAs, many of which are involved in the development and maintenance of neuronal synaptic connections. Indeed, disturbances in neuroplasticity is a key finding in FXS animal models, and an imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory neuronal circuits is believed to underlie many of the clinical manifestations of this disorder. Our knowledge of the proteins that are regulated by FMRP is rapidly growing, and this has led to the identification of multiple targets for therapeutic intervention, some of which have already moved into clinical trials or clinical practice.        
20981777	The behavioral phenotype of FMR1 mutations.          The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the behavioral phenotype of FMR1 mutations, including fragile X syndrome (FXS) in order to better understand the clinical involvement of individuals affected by mutations in this gene. FXS is associated with a wide range of intellectual and behavioral problems, some relatively mild and others quite severe. FXS is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and one of the most prevalent genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder. Learning difficulties, attentional problems, anxiety, aggressive behavior, stereotypies, and mood disorders are also frequent in FXS. Recent studies of children and adults have identified associations between FMR1 premutation and many of the same disorders. We examine the neurobehavioral phenotypes of FXS and FMR1 premutation as they manifest across the lifespan of the individual.          
27638450	Altered nocifensive behavior in animal models of autism spectrum disorder: The role of the nicotinic cholinergic system.         Autism, BTBR, Nicotine, Nicotine (PubChem CID: 89594), Nicotinic, Nociception, Nocifensive, Pain, Saccharin (PubChem CID: 656582), Social behavior, nAChR Caretakers and clinicians alike have long recognized that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can have altered sensory processing, which can contribute to its core symptoms. However, the pathobiology of sensory alterations in ASD is poorly understood. Here we examined nocifensive behavior in ASD mouse models, the BTBR T          +Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) and the fragile-X mental retardation-1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mice. We also examined the effects of nicotine on nocifensive behavior given that nicotine, a nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist that has antinociceptive effects, was shown to improve social deficits and decrease repetitive behaviors in BTBR mice. Compared to respective controls, both BTBR and Fmr1-KO had hyporesponsiveness to noxious thermal stimuli and electrical stimulation of C-sensory fibers, normal responsiveness to electrical stimulation of Aβ- and Aδ-fiber, and hyperresponsiveness to visceral pain after acetic acid intraperitoneal injection. In BTBR, nicotine at lower doses increased, whereas at higher doses, it decreased hotplate latency compared to vehicle. In a significantly different effect pattern, in control mice, nicotine had antinociceptive effects to noxious heat only at the high dose. Interestingly, these nocifensive behavior alterations and differential responses to nicotine antinociceptive effects in BTBR mice were associated with significant downregulation of α3, α4, α5, α7, β2, β3, and β4 nAChR subunits in several cerebral regions both, during embryonic development and adulthood. Taken together, these findings further implicate nAChRs in behaviors alterations in the BTBR model and lend support to the hypothesis that nAChRs may be a target for treatment of behavior deficits and sensory dysfunction in ASD.
27643697	Changes in insulin-like growth factor signaling alter phenotypes in Fragile X Mice.         AKT signaling, ERK signaling, Fragile X syndrome, IGF1, IGF1R, IGF2, Insulin-like growth factors, autism spectrum disorders, model mice, signaling pathways Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited form of intellectual disability that is usually caused by expansion of a polymorphic CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the X-linked FMR1 gene, which leads to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. Two non-neurological phenotypes of FXS are enlarged testes and connective tissue dysplasia, which could be caused by alterations in a growth factor signaling pathway. FXS patients also frequently have autistic-like symptoms, suggesting that the signaling pathways affected in FXS may overlap with those affected in autism. Identifying these pathways is important for both understanding the effects of FMR1 inactivation and developing treatments for both FXS and autism. Here we show that decreasing the levels of the insulin-like growth factor (Igf) receptor 1 corrects a number of phenotypes in the mouse model of FXS, including macro-orchidism, and that increasing the levels of IGF2 exacerbates the seizure susceptibility phenotype. These results suggest that the pathways altered by the loss of the FMR1-encoded protein (FMRP) may overlap with the pathways affected by changes in Igf signaling or that one or more of the proteins that play a role in Igf signaling could interact with FMRP. They also indicate a new set of potential targets for drug treatment of FXS and autism spectrum disorders.          
27643955	Splice form-dependent regulation of axonal arbor complexity by FMRP.         RNA granule, axon branching, fragile X syndrome, local translation, neurite outgrowth The autism-related protein Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA binding protein that plays important roles during both nervous system development and experience dependent plasticity. Alternative splicing of the Fmr1 locus gives rise to 12 different FMRP splice forms that differ in the functional and regulatory domains they contain as well as in their expression profile among brain regions and across development. Complete loss of FMRP leads to morphological and functional changes in neurons, including an increase in the size and complexity of the axonal arbor. To investigate the relative contribution of the FMRP splice forms to the regulation of axon morphology, we overexpressed individual splice forms in cultured wild type rat cortical neurons. FMRP overexpression led to a decrease in axonal arbor complexity that suggests that FMRP regulates axon branching. This reduction in complexity was specific to three splice forms-the full-length splice form 1, the most highly expressed splice form 7, and splice form 9. A focused analysis of splice form 7 revealed that this regulation is independent of RNA binding. Instead this regulation is disrupted by mutations affecting phosphorylation of a conserved serine as well as by mutating the nuclear export sequence. Surprisingly, this mutation in the nuclear export sequence also led to increased localization to the distal axonal arbor. Together, these findings reveal domain-specific functions of FMRP in the regulation of axonal complexity that may be controlled by differential expression of FMRP splice forms. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

23235829	FMRP targets distinct mRNA sequence elements to regulate protein expression.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a multi-organ disease that leads to mental retardation, macro-orchidism in males and premature ovarian insufficiency in female carriers. FXS is also a prominent monogenic disease associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). FXS is typically caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) expression, which codes for the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Here we report the discovery of distinct RNA-recognition elements that correspond to the two independent RNA-binding domains of FMRP, in addition to the binding sites within the messenger RNA targets for wild-type and I304N mutant FMRP isoforms and the FMRP paralogues FXR1P and FXR2P (also known as FXR1 and FXR2). RNA-recognition-element frequency, ratio and distribution determine target mRNA association with FMRP. Among highly enriched targets, we identify many genes involved in ASD and show that FMRP affects their protein levels in human cell culture, mouse ovaries and human brain. Notably, we discovered that these targets are also dysregulated in Fmr1(-/-) mouse ovaries showing signs of premature follicular overdevelopment. These results indicate that FMRP targets share signalling pathways across different cellular contexts. As the importance of signalling pathways in both FXS and ASD is becoming increasingly apparent, our results provide a ranked list of genes as basis for the pursuit of new therapeutic targets for these neurological disorders.        
29217836	Drug development for neurodevelopmental disorders: lessons learned from fragile X syndrome.          Neurodevelopmental disorders such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) result in lifelong cognitive and behavioural deficits and represent a major public health burden. FXS is the most frequent monogenic form of intellectual disability and autism, and the underlying pathophysiology linked to its causal gene, FMR1, has been the focus of intense research. Key alterations in synaptic function thought to underlie this neurodevelopmental disorder have been characterized and rescued in animal models of FXS using genetic and pharmacological approaches. These robust preclinical findings have led to the implementation of the most comprehensive drug development programme undertaken thus far for a genetically defined neurodevelopmental disorder, including phase IIb trials of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonists and a phase III trial of a GABA        B receptor agonist. However, none of the trials has been able to unambiguously demonstrate efficacy, and they have also highlighted the extent of the knowledge gaps in drug development for FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In this Review, we examine potential issues in the previous studies and future directions for preclinical and clinical trials. FXS is at the forefront of efforts to develop drugs for neurodevelopmental disorders, and lessons learned in the process will also be important for such disorders.
29218006	Reduced Levels of the Synaptic Functional Regulator FMRP in Dentate Gyrus of the Aging Sprague-Dawley Rat.         Fragile X mental retardation protein, Fragile X syndrome, RNA-binding protein, brain aging, dentate gyrus, proteomics Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) encoded by Fragile X mental retardation 1 (        FMR1) gene is a RNA-binding regulator of mRNA translation, transport and stability with multiple targets responsible for proper synaptic function. Epigenetic silencing of FMR1 gene expression leads to the development of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) that is characterized by intellectual disability and other behavioral problems including autism. In the rat FXS model, the lack of FMRP caused a deficit in hippocampal-dependent memory. However, the hippocampal changes of FMRP in aging rats are not fully elucidated. The current study addresses the changes in FMRP levels in dentate gyrus (DG) from young (17 weeks) and aging (22 months) Sprague - Dawley rats. The aging animal group showed significant decline in spatial reference memory. Protein samples from five rats per each group were analyzed by quantitative proteomic analysis resulting in 153 significantly changed proteins. FMRP showed significant reduction in aging animals which was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of the differential protein dataset revealed several functionally related protein groups with individual interactions with FMRP. These include high representation of the RNA translation and processing machinery connected to FMRP and other RNA-binding regulators including CAPRIN1, the members of Pumilio (PUM) and CUG-BP, Elav-like (CELF) family, and YTH N(6)-methyladenosine RNA-binding proteins (YTHDF). The results of the current study point to the important role of FMRP and regulation of RNA processing in the rat DG and memory decline during the aging process.
28590057	Behavioral abnormalities in the Fmr1-KO2 mouse model of fragile X syndrome: The relevance of early life phases.         Fragile X syndrome, adolescence, anxiety, autism, cognition, development, social interaction Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a developmental disorder caused by a mutation in the X-linked FMR1 gene, coding for the FMRP protein which is largely involved in synaptic function. FXS patients present several behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity, anxiety, sensory hyper-responsiveness, and cognitive deficits. Autistic symptoms, e.g., altered social interaction and communication, are also often observed: FXS is indeed the most common monogenic cause of autism. Mouse models of FXS are therefore of great interest for research on both FXS and autistic pathologies. The Fmr1-KO2 mouse line is the most recent FXS model, widely used for brain studies; surprisingly, little is known about the face validity of this model, i.e., its FXS-like behavioral phenotype. Furthermore, no data are available for the age-related expression of the pathological phenotypes in this mouse line, a critical issue for modelling neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we performed an extensive behavioral characterization of the KO2 model at infancy, adolescent and adult ages. Hyperactivity, altered emotionality, sensory hyper-responsiveness and memory deficits were already present in KO mice at adolescence and remained evident at adulthood. Alterations in social behaviors were instead observed only in young KO animals: during the first 2 weeks of life, KOs emitted longer ultrasonic vocalizations compared to their WT littermates and as adolescents they displayed more aggressive behaviors towards a conspecific. These results strongly support the face validity of the KO2 mouse as a model for FXS, at the same time demonstrating that its ability to recapitulate social autistic-relevant phenotypes depends on early testing ages.

28607173	Tactile Defensiveness and Impaired Adaptation of Neuronal Activity in the         Fmr1 Knock-Out Mouse Model of Autism. Fragile X Syndrome, barrel cortex, behavior, calcium imaging, development, two photon Sensory hypersensitivity is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including fragile X syndrome (FXS), and frequently leads to tactile defensiveness. In mouse models of ASDs, there is mounting evidence of neuronal and circuit hyperexcitability in several brain regions, which could contribute to sensory hypersensitivity. However, it is not yet known whether or how sensory stimulation might trigger abnormal sensory processing at the circuit level or abnormal behavioral responses in ASD mouse models, especially during an early developmental time when experience-dependent plasticity shapes such circuits. Using a novel assay, we discovered exaggerated motor responses to whisker stimulation in young           Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice (postnatal days 14-16), a model of FXS. Adult Fmr1 KO mice actively avoided a stimulus that was innocuous to wild-type controls, a sign of tactile defensiveness. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons expressing GCaMP6s, we found no differences between wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice in overall whisker-evoked activity, though 45% fewer neurons in young Fmr1 KO mice responded in a time-locked manner. Notably, we identified a pronounced deficit in neuronal adaptation to repetitive whisker stimulation in both young and adult Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, impaired adaptation in cortical sensory circuits is a potential cause of tactile defensiveness in autism.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We use a novel paradigm of repetitive whisker stimulation and in vivo calcium imaging to assess tactile defensiveness and barrel cortex activity in young and adult Fmr1 knock-out mice, the mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS). We describe evidence of tactile defensiveness, as well as a lack of L2/3 neuronal adaptation in barrel cortex, during whisker stimulation. We propose that a defect in sensory adaptation within local neuronal networks, beginning at a young age and continuing into adulthood, likely contributes to sensory overreactivity in FXS and perhaps other ASDs.
28861483	Enhancement of Anandamide-Mediated Endocannabinoid Signaling Corrects Autism-Related Social Impairment.         CB1, Fragile X Syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, fatty acid amide hydrolase, social approach Introduction: We recently uncovered a signaling mechanism by which the endocannabinoid anandamide mediates the action of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that is crucial for social behavior, to control social reward. Oxytocin signaling has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and social reward is a key aspect of social functioning that is thought to be disrupted in ASD. Therefore, as a proof of principle for the core component of ASD-social impairment-we tested an endocannabinoid-enhancing compound on two widely studied mouse models of ASD, the BTBR and fmr1 (model of Fragile X Syndrome). Methods: We used the established three-chambered social approach test. We specifically increased the activity of anandamide by administering the compound URB597, a selective inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the hydrolytic enzyme for anandamide. Results: Remarkably, we found that FAAH blockade completely reversed the social impairment in both mouse models. CB1 receptor blockade prevented the prosocial action of FAAH inhibition in BTBR mice. These results were likely independent of effects on anxiety, as FAAH inhibition did not alter the performance of BTBR mice in the elevated plus maze. Conclusions: The results suggest that increasing anandamide activity at CB1 receptors improves ASD-related social impairment and identify FAAH as a novel therapeutic target for ASD.
28866801	Recent advances in assays for the fragile X-related disorders.          The fragile X-related disorders are a group of three clinical conditions resulting from the instability of a CGG-repeat tract at the 5' end of the FMR1 transcript. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) are disorders seen in carriers of FMR1 alleles with 55-200 repeats. Female carriers of these premutation (PM) alleles are also at risk of having a child who has an FMR1 allele with >200 repeats. Most of these full mutation (FM) alleles are epigenetically silenced resulting in a deficit of the FMR1 gene product, FMRP. This results in fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism. The diagnosis and study of these disorders is challenging, in part because the detection of alleles with large repeat numbers has, until recently, been either time-consuming or unreliable. This problem is compounded by the mosaicism for repeat length and/or DNA methylation that is frequently seen in PM and FM carriers. Furthermore, since AGG interruptions in the repeat tract affect the risk that a FM allele will be maternally transmitted, the ability to accurately detect these interruptions in female PM carriers is an additional challenge that must be met. This review will discuss some of the pros and cons of some recently described assays for these disorders, including those that detect FMRP levels directly, as well as emerging technologies that promise to improve the diagnosis of these conditions and to be useful in both basic and translational research settings.        
28869609	N        6-methyladenosine (m6A) recruits and repels proteins to regulate mRNA homeostasis.  RNA modifications are integral to the regulation of RNA metabolism. One abundant mRNA modification is N        6-methyladenosine (m6A), which affects various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, translation and degradation. Current knowledge about the proteins recruited to m6A to carry out these molecular processes is still limited. Here we describe comprehensive and systematic mass-spectrometry-based screening of m6A interactors in various cell types and sequence contexts. Among the main findings, we identified G3BP1 as a protein that is repelled by m6A and positively regulates mRNA stability in an m6A-regulated manner. Furthermore, we identified FMR1 as a sequence-context-dependent m6A reader, thus revealing a connection between an mRNA modification and an autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, our data represent a rich resource and shed further light on the complex interplay among m6A, m6A interactors and mRNA homeostasis.
28887386	Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Restricts Small Dye Iontophoresis Entry into Central Neurons.         Drosophila, dye coupling, gap junction, giant fiber circuit Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) loss causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a major disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and seizures. FMRP is both an RNA- and channel-binding regulator, with critical roles in neural circuit formation and function. However, it remains unclear how these FMRP activities relate to each other and how dysfunction in their absence underlies FXS neurological symptoms. In testing circuit level defects in the           Drosophila FXS model, we discovered a completely unexpected and highly robust neuronal dye iontophoresis phenotype in the well mapped giant fiber (GF) circuit. Controlled dye injection into the GF interneuron results in a dramatic increase in dye uptake in neurons lacking FMRP. Transgenic wild-type FMRP reintroduction rescues the mutant defect, demonstrating a specific FMRP requirement. This phenotype affects only small dyes, but is independent of dye charge polarity. Surprisingly, the elevated dye iontophoresis persists in shaking B mutants that eliminate gap junctions and dye coupling among GF circuit neurons. We therefore used a wide range of manipulations to investigate the dye uptake defect, including timed injection series, pharmacology and ion replacement, and optogenetic activity studies. The results show that FMRP strongly limits the rate of dye entry via a cytosolic mechanism. This study reveals an unexpected new phenotype in a physical property of central neurons lacking FMRP that could underlie aspects of FXS disruption of neural function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT FXS is a leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Although researchers established the causal link with FMRP loss >;25 years ago, studies continue to reveal diverse FMRP functions. The Drosophila FXS model is key to discovering new FMRP roles, because of its genetic malleability and individually identified neuron maps. Taking advantage of a well characterized Drosophila neural circuit, we discovered that neurons lacking FMRP take up dramatically more current-injected small dye. After examining many neuronal properties, we determined that this dye defect is cytoplasmic and occurs due to a highly elevated dye iontophoresis rate. We also report several new factors affecting neuron dye uptake. Understanding how FMRP regulates iontophoresis should reveal new molecular factors underpinning FXS dysfunction.
18565783	Parkinsonism in FMR1 premutation carriers may be indistinguishable from Parkinson disease.          Premutation carriers of repeat expansions in the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene develop kinetic tremor and ataxia or the 'fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome' (FXTAS). Affected FMR1 premutation carriers also have parkinsonism, but have not been reported to meet criteria for Parkinson disease. This case series illustrates that some patients who are FMR1 premutation carriers may appear by history and examination to have idiopathic Parkinson disease. Based on previous studies, it is likely that the genetic mutation and parkinsonism are associated. Although screening all PD patients is likely to be low yield, genetic testing of FMR1 in individuals with PD and a family history of fragile X syndrome, autism or developmental delay, or other related FMR1 phenotypes is warranted.        
18570292	Co-occurring conditions associated with FMR1 gene variations: findings from a national parent survey.          Parents enrolling in a national survey of families of children with fragile X (FX) reported whether each of their children had been diagnosed or treated for developmental delay or eight conditions frequently associated with FX: attention problems, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, self-injury, autism, seizures, anxiety, or depression. This article reports results for 976 full mutation males, 259 full mutation females, 57 premutation males, and 199 premutation females. Co-occurring conditions were frequently reported for all FMR1 gene variations. The number of co-occurring conditions experienced was strongly associated with parent reports of their child's ability to learn, adaptability, and quality of life. Most individuals with the full mutation experienced multiple co-occurring conditions, with a modal number of 4 for males and 2 for females. Most (>80%) full mutation males and females had been diagnosed or treated for attention problems. Premutation males, when compared with a matched group of non-FX males, were more likely to have been diagnosed or treated for developmental delay, attention problems, aggression, seizures, autism, and anxiety. Premutation females were more likely to have been diagnosed or treated for attention problems, anxiety, depression, and developmental delay. Clusters of conditions were identified, seeming to occur in an additive fashion. Self-injury, autism, and seizures rarely occurred in isolation, but were more likely in individuals who also had problems with attention, anxiety, and hyperactivity. The findings provide a reference point for future studies on the prevalence and nature of co-occurring conditions in FX; suggest the possibility that certain conditions cluster together; provide evidence that male and female carriers experience elevated rates of co-occurring conditions compared with matched groups of non-carrier children; and emphasize the importance of including an assessment of co-occurring conditions in any clinical evaluation of individuals with abnormal variation in the FMR1 gene.          
28316753	A resting EEG study of neocortical hyperexcitability and altered functional connectivity in fragile X syndrome.         Cross-frequency coupling, EEG, Fragile X syndrome, Gamma, Hyperexcitability, Top-down modulation Cortical hyperexcitability due to abnormal fast-spiking inhibitory interneuron function has been documented in           fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model of the fragile X syndrome which is the most common single gene cause of autism and intellectual disability.
28322282	Maternal immune activation dysregulation of the fetal brain transcriptome and relevance to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder.          Maternal immune activation (MIA) via infection during pregnancy is known to increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, it is unclear how MIA disrupts fetal brain gene expression in ways that may explain this increased risk. Here we examine how MIA dysregulates rat fetal brain gene expression (at a time point analogous to the end of the first trimester of human gestation) in ways relevant to ASD-associated pathophysiology. MIA downregulates expression of ASD-associated genes, with the largest enrichments in genes known to harbor rare highly penetrant mutations. MIA also downregulates expression of many genes also known to be persistently downregulated in the ASD cortex later in life and which are canonically known for roles in affecting prenatally late developmental processes at the synapse. Transcriptional and translational programs that are downstream targets of highly ASD-penetrant FMR1 and CHD8 genes are also heavily affected by MIA. MIA strongly upregulates expression of a large number of genes involved in translation initiation, cell cycle, DNA damage and proteolysis processes that affect multiple key neural developmental functions. Upregulation of translation initiation is common to and preserved in gene network structure with the ASD cortical transcriptome throughout life and has downstream impact on cell cycle processes. The cap-dependent translation initiation gene, EIF4E, is one of the most MIA-dysregulated of all ASD-associated genes and targeted network analyses demonstrate prominent MIA-induced transcriptional dysregulation of mTOR and EIF4E-dependent signaling. This dysregulation of translation initiation via alteration of the Tsc2-mTor-Eif4e axis was further validated across MIA rodent models. MIA may confer increased risk for ASD by dysregulating key aspects of fetal brain gene expression that are highly relevant to pathophysiology affecting ASD.        
28329674	β-Arrestin2 Couples Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 to Neuronal Protein Synthesis and Is a Potential Target to Treat Fragile X.         ERK, autism, biased ligands, fragile X, intellectual disability, long-term depression, mGluR5, metabotropic glutamate receptors, synaptic protein synthesis, β-arrestin2 Synaptic protein synthesis is essential for modification of the brain by experience and is aberrant in several genetically defined disorders, notably fragile X (FX), a heritable cause of autism and intellectual disability. Neural activity directs local protein synthesis via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu          5), yet how mGlu5 couples to the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate mRNA translation is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that β-arrestin2 mediates mGlu5-stimulated protein synthesis in the hippocampus and show that genetic reduction of β-arrestin2 corrects aberrant synaptic plasticity and cognition in the Fmr1-/y mouse model of FX. Importantly, reducing β-arrestin2 does not induce psychotomimetic activity associated with full mGlu5 inhibitors and does not affect Gq signaling. Thus, in addition to identifying a key requirement for mGlu5-stimulated protein synthesis, these data suggest that β-arrestin2-biased negative modulators of mGlu5 offer significant advantages over first-generation inhibitors for the treatment of FX and related disorders.
26294013	The quest for targeted therapy in fragile X syndrome.         FMR1, fragile X syndrome, outcome measure, preclinical, targeted therapy Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common, monogenetic cause of intellectual disability and autism-spectrum disorders. Although there is no effective therapy, greater understanding of disturbed neuronal pathways has introduced options for targeted therapy. But whereas many FXS phenotypes were improved in preclinical studies with drugs targeting these pathways in the FXS mouse model, attempts to translate these animal-model success stories into treatment of patients in clinical trials have been extremely disappointing. Complicating factors, particularly in animal studies, include mouse inbred strains, variability in functional studies between laboratories, publication bias and lack of reliable and objective primary outcome measures in both mice and patients. Possibly most important, however, is one factor that has been little explored: the complexity of the molecular imbalance in FXS and the need to simultaneously target several different disturbed pathways and different cellular compartments. New, well-conceived animal studies should generate more productive approaches in the quest for targeted therapy for FXS.         
26298628	Fragile X Syndrome FMRP Co-localizes with Regulatory Targets PSD-95, GABA Receptors, CaMKIIα, and mGluR5 at Fiber Cell Membranes in the Eye Lens.         Fragile X mental retardation protein, Fragile X syndrome, Gene expression, Lens, Model system, Neurodevelopment Fmr1 and FMRP underlie Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and are linked with related autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Fmr1 also has an essential role in eye and lens development. Lenses express FMRP along with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABARs), post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), Tyr-phosphatase STEP, CaMKIIα and Alzheimer's disease Aβ precursor protein, which are verified targets of FMRP regulation in neurons and outline major topics in FXS/ASD research. PSD-95 as well as CaMKIIα transcripts undergo polypryimidine tract binding protein dependent alternative splicing in lens, consistent with PSD-95 translation in lens. At least 13 GABAR subunits and GAD25/65/67 GABA metabolism enzymes are expressed in lenses beginning in embryonic development, matching neural development. Interestingly, GABAergic drugs (e.g. baclofen) studied as FXS/ASD therapeutics are shown to resolve developmental vision defects in experimental myopia. Here, we demonstrated that FMRP co-localizes at fiber cell membranes with PSD-95, GABAAδ, GABAAβ3, GABBR1, STEP, CaMKIIα, and mGluR5 in young adult lenses. GAD65 and GABA detection was greatest at the peri-nuclear lens region where fiber cell terminal differentiation occurs. These findings add to an extensive list of detailed parallels between fiber cell and neuron morphology and their lateral membrane spine/protrusions, also reflected in the shared expression of genes involved in the morphogenesis and function of these membrane structures, and shared use of associated regulatory mechanisms first described as distinguishing the neuronal phenotype. Future studies can determine if GABA levels currently studied as a FXS/ASD biomarker in the brain, and generated by GAD25/65/67 in a comparable cell environment in the lens, may be similarly responsive to Fmr1 mutation in lens. The present demonstration of FMRP and key regulatory targets in the lens identifies a potential for the lens to provide a new research venue, in the same individual, to inform about Fmr1/FMRP pathobiology in brain as well as lens.         
26307763	"Fmr1 deficiency promotes age-dependent alterations in the cortical synaptic proteome.         autism, fragile X, quantitative mass spectrometry, stable isotope labeling, synaptic protein synthesis Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability and other symptoms including autism. Although caused by the silencing of a single gene, Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1), the complexity of FXS pathogenesis is amplified because the encoded protein, FMRP, regulates the activity-dependent translation of numerous mRNAs. Although the mRNAs that associate with FMRP have been extensively studied, little is known regarding the proteins whose expression levels are altered, directly or indirectly, by loss of FMRP during brain development. Here we systematically measured protein expression in neocortical synaptic fractions from Fmr1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice at both adolescent and adult stages. Although hundreds of proteins are up-regulated in the absence of FMRP in young mice, this up-regulation is largely diminished in adulthood. Up-regulated proteins included previously unidentified as well as known targets involved in synapse formation and function and brain development and others linked to intellectual disability and autism. Comparison with putative FMRP target mRNAs and autism susceptibility genes revealed substantial overlap, consistent with the idea that the autism endophenotype of FXS is due to a ""multiple hit"" effect of FMRP loss, particularly within the PSD95 interactome. Through studies of de novo protein synthesis in primary cortical neurons from KO and WT mice, we found that neurons lacking FMRP produce nascent proteins at higher rates, many of which are synaptic proteins and encoded by FMRP target mRNAs. Our results provide a greatly expanded view of protein changes in FXS and identify age-dependent effects of FMRP in shaping the neuronal proteome.         "
26308557	Rescue of deficient amygdala tonic γ-aminobutyric acidergic currents in the Fmr-/y mouse model of fragile X syndrome by a novel γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-positive allosteric modulator.         GABA, GABAA receptor, amygdala, fragile X syndrome, positive allosteric modulator Alterations in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory transmission are emerging as a common component of many nervous system disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Tonic γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission provided by peri- and extrasynaptic GABA type A (GABAA ) receptors powerfully controls neuronal excitability and plasticity and, therefore, provides a rational therapeutic target for normalizing hyperexcitable networks across a variety of disorders, including ASDs. Our previous studies revealed tonic GABAergic deficits in principal excitatory neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the Fmr1(-/y) knockout (KO) mouse model fragile X syndrome. To correct amygdala deficits in tonic GABAergic neurotransmission in Fmr1(-/y) KO mice, we developed a novel positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, SGE-872, based on endogenously active neurosteroids. This study shows that SGE-872 is nearly as potent and twice as efficacious for positively modulating GABAA receptors as its parent molecule, allopregnanolone. Furthermore, at submicromolar concentrations (≤1 μM), SGE-872 is selective for tonic, extrasynaptic α4β3δ-containing GABAA receptors over typical synaptic α1β2γ2 receptors. We further find that SGE-872 strikingly rescues the tonic GABAergic transmission deficit in principal excitatory neurons in the Fmr1(-/y) KO BLA, a structure heavily implicated in the neuropathology of ASDs. Therefore, the potent and selective action of SGE-872 on tonic GABAA receptors containing α4 subunits may represent a novel and highly useful therapeutic avenue for ASDs and related disorders involving hyperexcitability of neuronal networks.          
26612855	"Accumulated common variants in the broader fragile X gene family modulate autistic phenotypes.         FMR1, FMR2, FXR1, FXR2, PGAS, miR‐181 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is mostly caused by a CGG triplet expansion in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). Up to 60% of affected males fulfill criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), making FXS the most frequent monogenetic cause of syndromic ASD. It is unknown, however, whether normal variants (independent of mutations) in the fragile X gene family (FMR1, FXR1, FXR2) and in FMR2 modulate autistic features. Here, we report an accumulation model of 8 SNPs in these genes, associated with autistic traits in a discovery sample of male patients with schizophrenia (N = 692) and three independent replicate samples: patients with schizophrenia (N = 626), patients with other psychiatric diagnoses (N = 111) and a general population sample (N = 2005). For first mechanistic insight, we contrasted microRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of selected extreme group subjects with high- versus low-risk constellation regarding the accumulation model. Thereby, the brain-expressed miR-181 species emerged as potential ""umbrella regulator"", with several seed matches across the fragile X gene family and FMR2. To conclude, normal variation in these genes contributes to the continuum of autistic phenotypes.          "
26627235	Compromising the phosphodependent regulation of the GABAAR β3 subunit reproduces the core phenotypes of autism spectrum disorders.         GABA receptor, autism spectrum disorder, phasic inhibition, phosphorylation, tonic inhibition Alterations in the efficacy of neuronal inhibition mediated by GABAA receptors (GABAARs) containing β3 subunits are continually implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In vitro, the plasma membrane stability of GABAARs is potentiated via phosphorylation of serine residues 408 and 409 (S408/9) in the β3 subunit, an effect that is mimicked by their mutation to alanines. To assess if modifications in β3 subunit expression contribute to ASDs, we have created a mouse in which S408/9 have been mutated to alanines (S408/9A). S408/9A homozygotes exhibited increased phasic, but decreased tonic, inhibition, events that correlated with alterations in the membrane stability and synaptic accumulation of the receptor subtypes that mediate these distinct forms of inhibition. S408/9A mice exhibited alterations in dendritic spine structure, increased repetitive behavior, and decreased social interaction, hallmarks of ASDs. ASDs are frequently comorbid with epilepsy, and consistent with this comorbidity, S408/9A mice exhibited a marked increase in sensitivity to seizures induced by the convulsant kainic acid. To assess the relevance of our studies using S408/9A mice for the pathophysiology of ASDs, we measured S408/9 phosphorylation in Fmr1 KO mice, a model of fragile X syndrome, the most common monogenetic cause of ASDs. Phosphorylation of S408/9 was selectively and significantly enhanced in Fmr1 KO mice. Collectively, our results suggest that alterations in phosphorylation and/or activity of β3-containing GABAARs may directly contribute to the pathophysiology of ASDs.         
26702437	"Structural-functional connectivity deficits of neocortical circuits in the Fmr1 (-/y) mouse model of autism.         Autism, DTI, Fragile X Syndrome, biomarker, connectopathy, fMRI, functional connectivity, neocortex, retrograde tracing, structural connectivity Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability disorder and a frequent cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is characterized by a high prevalence of sensory symptoms. Perturbations in the anatomical connectivity of neocortical circuits resulting in their functional defects have been hypothesized to contribute to the underlying etiology of these disorders. We tested this idea by probing alterations in the functional and structural connectivity of both local and long-ranging neocortical circuits in the Fmr1 (-/y) mouse model of FXS. To achieve this, we combined in vivo ultrahigh-field diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and viral tracing approaches in adult mice. Our results show an anatomical hyperconnectivity phenotype for the primary visual cortex (V1), but a disproportional low connectivity of V1 with other neocortical regions. These structural data are supported by defects in the structural integrity of the subcortical white matter in the anterior and posterior forebrain. These anatomical alterations might contribute to the observed functional decoupling across neocortical regions. We therefore identify FXS as a ""connectopathy,"" providing a translational model for understanding sensory processing defects and functional decoupling of neocortical areas in FXS and ASD.         "
26712713	Low Levels of HDL in Fragile X Syndrome Patients.         General area, HDL, Lipid biochemistry, Lipoproteins, Lipoproteins, LDL Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retardation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene resulting in the transcriptional silencing of the gene in the pathophysiology of Fragile X syndrome was hypothesized. 23 male patients affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1 gene) and 24 controls were included in the study. The serum levels of HDL-C were lower in FXS patients (p < 0.001). The serum levels triacylglycerols were higher in FXS patients (p = 0.007) Further study involving larger samples are necessary to confirm the results and define the health implications for abnormal lipid levels in FXS patients.        
27422057	Establishment of Reporter Lines for Detecting Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) Gene Reactivation in Human Neural Cells.         Drug discovery, FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, High throughput, Induced pluripotent stem cells, Luciferase Human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide unique opportunities for disease modeling and drug development. However, adapting hiPSCs or their differentiated progenies to high throughput assays for phenotyping or drug screening has been challenging. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and a major genetic cause of autism. FXS is caused by mutational trinucleotide expansion in the FMR1 gene leading to hypermethylation and gene silencing. One potential therapeutic strategy is to reactivate the silenced FMR1 gene, which has been attempted using both candidate chemicals and cell-based screening. However, molecules that effectively reactivate the silenced FMR1 gene are yet to be identified; therefore, a high throughput unbiased screen is needed. Here we demonstrate the creation of a robust FMR1-Nluc reporter hiPSC line by knocking in a Nano luciferase (Nluc) gene into the endogenous human FMR1 gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method. We confirmed that luciferase activities faithfully report FMR1 gene expression levels and showed that neural progenitor cells derived from this line could be optimized for high throughput screening. The FMR1-Nluc reporter line is a good resource for drug screening as well as for testing potential genetic reactivation strategies. In addition, our data provide valuable information for the generation of knockin human iPSC reporter lines for disease modeling, drug screening, and mechanistic studies.

27445731	Multiple Drug Treatments That Increase cAMP Signaling Restore Long-Term Memory and Aberrant Signaling in Fragile X Syndrome Models.         Fragile X, GSK-3β, PDE-4, group II mGluR, lithium, mTOR, tau Fragile X is the most common monogenic disorder associated with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, many patients are afflicted with executive dysfunction, ADHD, seizure disorder and sleep disturbances. Fragile X is caused by loss of FMRP expression, which is encoded by the FMR1 gene. Both the fly and mouse models of fragile X are also based on having no functional protein expression of their respective FMR1 homologs. The fly model displays well defined cognitive impairments and structural brain defects and the mouse model, although having subtle behavioral defects, has robust electrophysiological phenotypes and provides a tool to do extensive biochemical analysis of select brain regions. Decreased cAMP signaling has been observed in samples from the fly and mouse models of fragile X as well as in samples derived from human patients. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that strategies that increase cAMP signaling can rescue short term memory in the fly model and restore DHPG induced mGluR mediated long term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus to proper levels in the mouse model (McBride et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2011, 2015). Here, we demonstrate that the same three strategies used previously with the potential to be used clinically, lithium treatment, PDE-4 inhibitor treatment or mGluR antagonist treatment can rescue long term memory in the fly model and alter the cAMP signaling pathway in the hippocampus of the mouse model.         
20071534	Dysregulation of mTOR signaling in fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation and leading genetic cause of autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the gene product of Fmr1, is an RNA binding protein that negatively regulates translation in neurons. The Fmr1 knock-out mouse, a model of fragile X syndrome, exhibits cognitive deficits and exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression at CA1 synapses. However, the molecular mechanisms that link loss of function of FMRP to aberrant synaptic plasticity remain unclear. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade controls initiation of cap-dependent translation and is under control of mGluRs. Here we show that mTOR phosphorylation and activity are elevated in hippocampus of juvenile Fmr1 knock-out mice by four functional readouts: (1) association of mTOR with regulatory associated protein of mTOR; (2) mTOR kinase activity; (3) phosphorylation of mTOR downstream targets S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein; and (4) formation of eukaryotic initiation factor complex 4F, a critical first step in cap-dependent translation. Consistent with this, mGluR long-term depression at CA1 synapses of FMRP-deficient mice is exaggerated and rapamycin insensitive. We further show that the p110 subunit of the upstream kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its upstream activator PI3K enhancer PIKE, predicted targets of FMRP, are upregulated in knock-out mice. Elevated mTOR signaling may provide a functional link between overactivation of group I mGluRs and aberrant synaptic plasticity in the fragile X mouse, mechanisms relevant to impaired cognition in fragile X syndrome.        
28218269	Enhanced expression of ADCY1 underlies aberrant neuronal signalling and behaviour in a syndromic autism model.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by the loss of functional FMRP, is a leading cause of autism. Neurons lacking FMRP show aberrant mRNA translation and intracellular signalling. Here, we identify that, in Fmr1 knockout neurons, type 1 adenylyl cyclase (Adcy1) mRNA translation is enhanced, leading to excessive production of ADCY1 protein and insensitivity to neuronal stimulation. Genetic reduction of Adcy1 normalizes the aberrant ERK1/2- and PI3K-mediated signalling, attenuates excessive protein synthesis and corrects dendritic spine abnormality in Fmr1 knockout mice. Genetic reduction of Adcy1 also ameliorates autism-related symptoms including repetitive behaviour, defective social interaction and audiogenic seizures. Moreover, peripheral administration of NB001, an experimental compound that preferentially suppresses ADCY1 activity over other ADCY subtypes, attenuates the behavioural abnormalities in Fmr1 knockout mice. These results demonstrate a connection between the elevated Adcy1 translation and abnormal ERK1/2 signalling and behavioural symptoms in FXS.        
28223318	A         Drosophila model of Fragile X syndrome exhibits defects in phagocytosis by innate immune cells.  Fragile X syndrome, the most common known monogenic cause of autism, results from the loss of FMR1, a conserved, ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein. Recent evidence suggests that Fragile X syndrome and other types of autism are associated with immune system defects. We found that           Drosophila melanogaster Fmr1 mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to bacterial infection and decreased phagocytosis of bacteria by systemic immune cells. Using tissue-specific RNAi-mediated knockdown, we showed that Fmr1 plays a cell-autonomous role in the phagocytosis of bacteria. Fmr1 mutants also exhibit delays in two processes that require phagocytosis by glial cells, the immune cells in the brain: neuronal clearance after injury in adults and the development of the mushroom body, a brain structure required for learning and memory. Delayed neuronal clearance is associated with reduced recruitment of activated glia to the site of injury. These results suggest a previously unrecognized role for Fmr1 in regulating the activation of phagocytic immune cells both in the body and the brain.
28232951	Clinical and Molecular Assessment in a Female with Fragile X Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis.         ERK1/2, Fragile X syndrome, Protein synthesis, Tuberous sclerosis, mTORC1 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and tuberous sclerosis (TSC) are genetic disorders that result in intellectual disability and an increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). While the clinical presentation of each disorder is distinct, the molecular causes are linked to a disruption in the mTORC1 (mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) and ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase) signaling pathways.          
22900020	Haploinsufficiency of Cyfip1 produces fragile X-like phenotypes in mice.          Copy number variation (CNV) at the 15q11.2 region, which includes a gene that codes for CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1), has been implicated in autism, intellectual disability and additional neuropsychiatric phenotypes. In the current study we studied the function of Cyfip1 in synaptic physiology and behavior, using mice with a disruption of the Cyfip1 gene.          
22903700	Screening for the presence of FMR1 premutation alleles in a Spanish population with fibromyalgia.          Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation carriers, who are at risk of having children with fragile X Syndrome, were initially considered as clinically unaffected. However, recent clinical and molecular studies have shifted this point of view. The incidence of premutation in the general population is substantial. Apart from the well-documented fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia and fragile X premature ovarian insufficiency, there is a broad constellation of symptoms including depression, anxiety, muscle pain, autoimmune and thyroid disease, chronic fatigue, and fibromyalgia that has been described, particularly in females with the premutation (55-200 repeats). Fibromyalgia (FM) is the most common cause of widespread pain and comprises a heterogeneous group of patients, affecting 2-3 % of the general population. We analyzed the FMR1 gene in a cohort of females diagnosed with fibromyalgia in order to assess the incidence of premutated alleles. CGG repeat size was determined in 353 females suffering from FM and results were compared with a control group. Four premutated carriers in the FM group were detected. The observed incidence is higher than that described for a normal female population (1/88 vs 1/250). The early detection of premutation carriers for the FMR1 gene among individuals diagnosed with fibromyalgia is important and would be helpful in correct genetic counseling of patients and their families, who may be at risk of having children with fragile X syndrome, the most common known cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism. Our data should be cautiously interpreted based on just this study; nevertheless, screening for the FMR1 gene in FM patients at least with presentations suggestive of FMR1 gene-related disease seems recommendable.        
20643379	Fragile X: leading the way for targeted treatments in autism.          Two different mutations in the FMR1 gene may lead to autism. The full mutation, with >200 CGG repeats in the 5' end of FMR1, leads to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of FMR1, resulting in absence or deficiency of the protein product, FMRP. Deficiency of FMRP in the brain causes fragile X syndrome (FXS). Autism occurs in approximately 30% of those with FXS, and pervasive developmental disorders-not otherwise specified occur in an additional 30%. FMRP is an RNA binding protein that modulates receptor-mediated dendritic translation; deficiency leads to dysregulation of many proteins important for synaptic plasticity. Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5) activated translation is upregulated in FXS, and new targeted treatments that act on this system include mGluR5 antagonists and GABA agonists, which may reverse the cognitive and behavioral deficits in FXS. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is one of the proteins elevated in FXS, and minocycline reduces excess MMP-9 activity in the Fmr1 knockout mouse model of FXS. Both minocycline and mGluR5 antagonists are currently being evaluated in patients with FXS through controlled treatment trials. The premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) may also contribute to the mechanism of autism in approximately 10% of males and 2-3% of females. Premutations with <150 repeats exert cellular effects through a different molecular mechanism, one that involves elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA, CGG-mediated toxicity to neurons, early cell death, and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. In those with large premutations (150-200), lowered levels of FMRP also occur.          
16685180	Autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in boys with the fragile X premutation.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a full mutation expansion (>200 CGG repeats) in the FMR1 gene that results in a deficiency of the fragile X mental retardation protein. Although most individuals with the premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) are considered unaffected by FXS, recent case studies have documented children with the premutation who have cognitive deficits, behavioral problems, and/or autism spectrum disorders. The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in boys with the premutation who presented as probands, in brothers with the premutation who did not present as probands, and in normal brothers of premutation and/or full mutation carriers. Participants included 43 male children: 14 probands who presented to clinic, 13 nonprobands who were identified through cascade testing (routine genetic testing of family members after identification of a proband) and confirmed to have the premutation, and a control group of 16 male siblings of individuals with the fragile X premutation or full mutation who were negative for the FMR1 mutation. Participants came from 1 of 2 collaborative sites: University of California, Davis and La Trobe University in Australia. Parents completed the Conners' Global Index-Parent Version for assessing symptoms of ADHD and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) for identifying symptoms of ASD. Children who were in the ASD range on the SCQ (n = 13) underwent further evaluation with either the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (n = 10) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (n = 3). A final diagnosis of ASD included clinical assessment utilizing DSM-IV-TR criteria in addition to the standardized assessments. There was a higher rate of ASD in boys with the premutation presenting as probands (p < 0.001) or nonprobands (p < .04) compared with sibling controls without the premutation. In addition, probands had a significant increase in ADHD symptoms compared with controls (p < .0001). Of the probands, 93% had symptoms of ADHD and 79% had ASD. In the nonproband premutation group, 38% had symptoms of ADHD and 8% had ASD. Thirteen percent of sibling controls had symptoms of ADHD and none had ASD. IQ scores were similar in all 3 groups (p = .13), but the use of psychotropic medications was significantly higher in probands with the premutation compared with that in controls (p < .0001). Developmental problems have been observed in premutation carriers, particularly those who present clinically with behavioral difficulties. Although this study is based on a small sample size, it suggests that premutation carriers, even those who do not present clinically, may be at increased risk for an ASD and/or symptoms of ADHD. If the premutation is identified through cascade testing, then further assessment should be carried out for symptoms of ADHD, social deficits, or learning disabilities.        
17197085	Major defects in neocortical GABAergic inhibitory circuits in mice lacking the fragile X mental retardation protein.          This study focused on the cytoarchitectonic and morphological differences in GABA-releasing interneurons between adult Fmr1 knock-out (FMR1KO) and wild-type (WT) mice in the somatosensory cortex. Our results showed a robust reorganization of neocortical, but not hippocampal inhibitory circuits in the FMR1KO mouse. The reorganization is characterized by a significant reduction (20%, p<0.001) in the densities of parvalbumin (PV)-positive, but not calbindin (CB) and calretinin (CR)-positive interneurons. A significant enlargement of soma size and an altered lamina distribution of PV but not CR and CB cells was also observed. Additionally, there was a modest but significant increase in TrkB-immunoreactivity in PV-positive cells in the FMR1KO mouse. These results provide the first report showing significant alterations of GABA-releasing interneurons in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Uncovering the changes in specific GABAergic inhibitory circuits could help understand mechanisms underlying the behavior deficits of fragile X syndrome and autism.        
25500855	Anti-neuronal antibodies in patients with fragile X syndrome: is there a role of autoimmunity in its pathogenesis?          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder with a broad spectrum of involvement, including cognitive and behavioural impairments of varying degrees with specific physical features and a strong association with autism.          
23320543	Fragile X syndrome: clinical, cytogenetic and molecular screening among autism spectrum disorder children in Indonesia.         FMR1 screening, Indonesia, autism spectrum disorders, fragile X site, fragile X syndrome Fragile X testing is a priority in the evaluation of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) cases because identification of the FMR1 mutation leads to new treatment options. This study is focused on determining the prevalence of the FMR1 gene mutation among ASD cases in Indonesia. DSM-IV-TR criteria were administered to diagnose ASD; symptom severity was classified using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Cytogenetic analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and Southern blot for FMR1 gene analysis were carried out to confirm the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. The fragile X site and FMR1 full mutation allele were identified in 3 out of 65 (4.6%) and 4 out of 65 (6.15%) children aged 3-17 years (57 boys and 8 girls), respectively. The Fragile X laboratory workup is essential in the evaluation of patients with ASD. Molecular analysis is most accurate, while cytogenetic documentation of the fragile X site can also be useful if molecular testing is not available.          
23327738	Monogenic mouse models of social dysfunction: implications for autism.         Fmr1, Fragile X syndrome, Mouse models, Mu receptor, Opioid system, Social behaviors, Ultrasonic communication Autism is a pervasive disorder characterized by a complex symptomatology, based principally on social dysfunction. The disorder has a highly complex, largely genetic etiology, involving an impressive variety of genes, the precise contributions of which still remain to be determined. For this reason, a reductionist approach to the study of autism has been proposed, employing monogenic animal models of social dysfunction, either by targeting a candidate gene, or by mimicking a single-gene disorder characterized by autistic symptoms. In the present review, we discuss this monogenic approach by comparing examples of each strategy: the mu opioid receptor knock-out (KO) mouse line, which targets the opioid system (known to be involved in the control of social behaviors); and the Fmr1-KO mouse, a model for Fragile X syndrome (a neurodevelopmental syndrome that includes autistic symptoms). The autistic-relevant behavioral phenotypes of the mu-opioid and Fmr1-KO mouse lines are described here, summarizing previous work by our research group and others, but also providing novel experimental evidence. Relevant factors influencing the validity of the two models, such as sex differences and age at testing, are also addressed, permitting an extensive evaluation of the advantages and limits of monogenic mouse models for autism.           
17326118	"The study of autism as a distributed disorder.          Past autism research has often been dedicated to tracing the causes of the disorder to a localized neurological abnormality, a single functional network, or a single cognitive-behavioral domain. In this review, I argue that autism is a ""distributed disorder"" on various levels of study (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurofunctional, behavioral). ""Localizing"" models are therefore not promising. The large array of potential genetic risk factors suggests that multiple (or all) emerging functional brain networks are affected during early development. This is supported by widespread growth abnormalities throughout the brain. Interactions during development between affected functional networks and atypical experiential effects (associated with atypical behavior) in children with autism further complicate the neurological bases of the disorder, resulting in an ""exponentially distributed"" profile. Promising approaches to a better characterization of neural endophenotypes in autism are provided by techniques investigating white matter and connectivity, such as MR spectroscopy, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), and functional connectivity MRI. According to a recent hypothesis, the autistic brain is generally characterized by ""underconnectivity."" However, not all findings are consistent with this view. The concepts and methodology of functional connectivity need to be refined and results need to be corroborated by anatomical studies (such as DTI tractography) before definitive conclusions can be drawn.          "
25168779	Quantitative phosphoproteomics of murine Fmr1-KO cell lines provides new insights into FMRP-dependent signal transduction mechanisms.         FMR1, FMRP, MEF, autism, fragile X syndrome, phosphoproteomics Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that has a major effect on neuronal protein synthesis. Transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene leads to loss of FMRP and development of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common known hereditary cause of intellectual impairment and autism. Here we utilize SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics to analyze murine FMR1(-) and FMR1(+) fibroblastic cell lines derived from FMR1-KO embryos to identify proteins and phosphorylation sites dysregulated as a consequence of FMRP loss. We quantify FMRP-related changes in the levels of 5,023 proteins and 6,133 phosphorylation events and map them onto major signal transduction pathways. Our study confirms global downregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and decrease in phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 in the absence of FMRP, which is connected to attenuation of long-term potentiation. We detect differential expression of several key proteins from the p53 pathway, pointing to the involvement of p53 signaling in dysregulated cell cycle control in FXS. Finally, we detect differential expression and phosphorylation of proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing and nuclear transport, as well as Wnt and calcium signaling, such as PLC, PKC, NFAT, and cPLA2. We postulate that calcium homeostasis is likely affected in molecular pathogenesis of FXS.         
25171808	Point mutation frequency in the FMR1 gene as revealed by fragile X syndrome screening.         FMR1, Fragile X syndrome, High resolution melting (HRM) analysis, Mental retardation, Missense mutation Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability, developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders. This syndrome is due to a functional loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP, and, in most cases, it is caused by CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 promoter. Yet, also other FMR1 mutations may cause a FXS-like phenotype. Since standard molecular testing does not include the analysis of the FMR1 coding region, the prevalence of point mutations causing FXS is not well known. Here, high resolution melting (HRM) was used to screen for FMR1 gene mutations in 508 males with clinical signs of mental retardation and developmental delay, but without CGG and GCC repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene and AFF2 genes, respectively. Sequence variations were identified by HRM analysis and verified by direct DNA sequencing. Two novel missense mutations (p.Gly482Ser in one patient and p.Arg534His in two unrelated patients), one intronic and two 3'-untranslated region (UTR) variations were identified in the FMR1 gene. Missense mutations in the FMR1 gene might account for a considerable proportion of cases in male patients with FXS-related symptoms, such as those linked to mental retardation and developmental delay.           
28465421	Hyperactive locomotion in a         Drosophila model is a functional readout for the synaptic abnormalities underlying fragile X syndrome.  Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual disability and autism and affects ~1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. The discovery of effective treatments for FXS has been hampered by the lack of effective animal models and phenotypic readouts for drug screening. FXS ensues from the epigenetic silencing or loss-of-function mutation of the           fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which encodes an RNA binding protein that associates with and represses the translation of target mRNAs. We previously found that the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) downstream of augmented synthesis of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type 2 receptor (BMPR2) promotes aberrant synaptic development in mouse and Drosophila models of FXS and that these molecular and cellular markers were correlated in patients with FXS. We report that larval locomotion is augmented in a Drosophila FXS model. Genetic or pharmacological intervention on the BMPR2-LIMK pathway ameliorated the synaptic abnormality and locomotion phenotypes of FXS larvae, as well as hyperactivity in an FXS mouse model. Our study demonstrates that (i) the BMPR2-LIMK pathway is a promising therapeutic target for FXS and (ii) the locomotion phenotype of FXS larvae is a quantitative functional readout for the neuromorphological phenotype associated with FXS and is amenable to the screening novel FXS therapeutics.
25632275	FRAGILE X SYNDROME: PSYCHIATRIC MANIFESTATIONS, ASSESSMENT AND EMERGING THERAPIES.         assessment, fragile X syndrome, neurobiology, psychiatric symptoms, treatment Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities, is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by the amplification of a CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (        FMR1). Prevalence estimates of the disorder are approximately 1/3600. Psychiatric manifestations of the disorder include anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, mood instability and aggression. In this article we review the above psychiatric manifestations and challenges to accurate assessment. We also discuss how the neurobiological underpinnings of these symptoms are beginning to be understood and can help guide treatment.
25641759	DYRK1A mutations in two unrelated patients.         Autism spectrum disorder, DYRK1A mutation, Dysmorphism, Intellectual disability The Dual-specify tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene has been extensively studied for its role in the pathophysiology of intellectual disability (ID) in Down syndrome. The rise of next generation sequencing (NGS) and array-CGH (aCGH) in diagnostic settings for the evaluation of patients with ID allowed the identification of 17 patients carrying heterozygous genetic aberrations involving DYRK1A to date. The rate of DYRK1A mutations in this population reaches >1% in published NGS studies. The current report aims at further defining the phenotype of this encephalopathy with the detailed report of two unrelated patients. Both patients were boys with developmental delay, febrile seizures, facial dysmorphism and brain atrophy on MRI. Patient #1 had autistic behaviors and micropenis and Patient #2 had stereotypies and microcephaly. NGS analyses identified heterozygous de novo variants in DYRK1A: the c.613C >T (p.Arg205*) nonsense mutation in Patient #1 and the c.932C >T (p.Ser311Phe) missense mutation in Patient #2. Together with previously reported cases, patients with DYRK1A mutations share many clinical features and may have a recognizable phenotype that includes, by decreasing order of frequency: developmental delay or ID with behaviors suggesting autism spectrum disorder, microcephaly, epileptic seizures, facial dysmorphism including ear anomalies (large ears, hypoplastic lobes), thin lips, short philtrum and frontal bossing. Delineation of the phenotype/genotype correlation is not feasible at the moment and will be a challenge for the coming years.          
25416280	Human FMRP contains an integral tandem Agenet (Tudor) and KH motif in the amino terminal domain.          Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of intellectual disability and autism, is due to mutational silencing of the FMR1 gene leading to the absence of its gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is a selective RNA binding protein owing to two central K-homology domains and a C-terminal arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) box. However, several properties of the FMRP amino terminus are unresolved. It has been documented for over a decade that the amino terminus has the ability to bind RNA despite having no recognizable functional motifs. Moreover, the amino terminus has recently been shown to bind chromatin and influence the DNA damage response as well as function in the presynaptic space, modulating action potential duration. We report here the amino terminal crystal structures of wild-type FMRP, and a mutant (R138Q) that disrupts the amino terminus function, containing an integral tandem Agenet and discover a novel KH motif.           
25420222	Cardiac autonomic regulation in autism and Fragile X syndrome: a review.          Despite the significance of efforts to understand the biological basis of autism, progress in this area has been hindered, in part, by the considerable heterogeneity in the disorder. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a monogenic condition associated with high risk for autism, may pave the way for the dissection of biological heterogeneity within idiopathic autism. This article adopts a cross-syndrome biomarker approach to evaluate potentially overlapping profiles of cardiac arousal dysregulation (and broader autonomic dysfunction) in autism and FXS. Approaches such as this, aimed at delineating shared mechanisms across genetic syndromes, hold great potential for improving diagnostic precision, promoting earlier identification, and uncovering key systems that can be targeted in pharmaceutical/behavioral interventions. Biomarker approaches may be vital to deconstructing complex psychiatric disorders and are currently promoted as such by major research initiatives such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Evidence reviewed here supports physiological dysregulation in a subset of individuals with autism, as evidenced by patterns of hyperarousal and dampened parasympathetic vagal tone that overlap with the well-documented physiological profile of FXS. Moreover, there is growing support for a link between aberrant cardiac activity and core deficits associated with autism, such as communication and social impairment. The delineation of physiological mechanisms common to autism and FXS could lend insight into relationships between genetic etiology and behavioral endstates, highlighting FMR1 as a potential candidate gene. Research gaps and potential pitfalls are discussed to inform timely, well-controlled biomarker research that will ultimately promote better diagnosis and treatment of autism and associated conditions.          
25767309	Fragile X syndrome.         Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, Fragile X Syndrome, Genetic Counselling, Therapeutics, intellectual disability Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disease due to a CGG trinucleotide expansion, named full mutation (greater than 200 CGG repeats), in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene locus Xq27.3; which leads to an hypermethylated region in the gene promoter therefore silencing it and lowering the expression levels of the fragile X mental retardation 1, a protein involved in synaptic plasticity and maturation. Individuals with FXS present with intellectual disability, autism, hyperactivity, long face, large or prominent ears and macroorchidism at puberty and thereafter. Most of the young children with FXS will present with language delay, sensory hyper arousal and anxiety. Girls are less affected than boys, only 25% have intellectual disability. Given the genomic features of the syndrome, there are patients with a number of triplet repeats between 55 and 200, known as premutation carriers. Most carriers have a normal IQ but some have developmental problems. The diagnosis of FXS has evolved from karyotype with special culture medium, to molecular techniques that are more sensitive and specific including PCR and Southern Blot. During the last decade, the advances in the knowledge of FXS, has led to the development of investigations on pharmaceutical management or targeted treatments for FXS. Minocycline and sertraline have shown efficacy in children.         
17880640	Epidemiology of autism spectrum disorder in Portugal: prevalence, clinical characterization, and medical conditions.          The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and identify its clinical characterization, and medical conditions in a paediatric population in Portugal. A school survey was conducted in elementary schools, targeting 332,808 school-aged children in the mainland and 10,910 in the Azores islands. Referred children were directly assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn), the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Clinical history and a laboratory investigation was performed. In parallel, a systematic multi-source search of children known to have autism was carried out in a restricted region. The global prevalence of ASD per 10,000 was 9.2 in mainland, and 15.6 in the Azores, with intriguing regional differences. A diversity of associated medical conditions was documented in 20%, with an unexpectedly high rate of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders.        
17895972	The cyclic AMP cascade is altered in the fragile X nervous system.          Fragile X syndrome (FX), the most common heritable cause of mental retardation and autism, is a developmental disorder characterized by physical, cognitive, and behavioral deficits. FX results from a trinucleotide expansion mutation in the fmr1 gene that reduces levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Although research efforts have focused on FMRP's impact on mGluR signaling, how the loss of FMRP leads to the individual symptoms of FX is not known. Previous studies on human FX blood cells revealed alterations in the cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) cascade. We tested the hypothesis that cAMP signaling is altered in the FX nervous system using three different model systems. Induced levels of cAMP in platelets and in brains of fmr1 knockout mice are substantially reduced. Cyclic AMP induction is also significantly reduced in human FX neural cells. Furthermore, cAMP production is decreased in the heads of FX Drosophila and this defect can be rescued by reintroduction of the dfmr gene. Our results indicate that a robust defect in cAMP production in FX is conserved across species and suggest that cAMP metabolism may serve as a useful biomarker in the human disease population. Reduced cAMP induction has implications for the underlying causes of FX and autism spectrum disorders. Pharmacological agents known to modulate the cAMP cascade may be therapeutic in FX patients and can be tested in these models, thus supplementing current efforts centered on mGluR signaling.        
17848915	Advances in behavioral genetics: mouse models of autism.          Autism is a neurodevelopmental syndrome with markedly high heritability. The diagnostic indicators of autism are core behavioral symptoms, rather than definitive neuropathological markers. Etiology is thought to involve complex, multigenic interactions and possible environmental contributions. In this review, we focus on genetic pathways with multiple members represented in autism candidate gene lists. Many of these pathways can also be impinged upon by environmental risk factors associated with the disorder. The mouse model system provides a method to experimentally manipulate candidate genes for autism susceptibility, and to use environmental challenges to drive aberrant gene expression and cell pathology early in development. Mouse models for fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome and other disorders associated with autistic-like behavior have elucidated neuropathology that might underlie the autism phenotype, including abnormalities in synaptic plasticity. Mouse models have also been used to investigate the effects of alterations in signaling pathways on neuronal migration, neurotransmission and brain anatomy, relevant to findings in autistic populations. Advances have included the evaluation of mouse models with behavioral assays designed to reflect disease symptoms, including impaired social interaction, communication deficits and repetitive behaviors, and the symptom onset during the neonatal period. Research focusing on the effect of gene-by-gene interactions or genetic susceptibility to detrimental environmental challenges may further understanding of the complex etiology for autism.        
26281226	[General and Specific Mechanisms of Visual Cognitive Function Impairment in People with FMRP Deficit].          The purpose of this article is to provide the overview of visual cognitive development in subjects with FMRP deficit. Description of fragile X mental retardation syndrome is presented in the article, that is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and one of the most prevalent genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder. The syndrome is associated with deficit of fragile X mental retardation protein following FMR1-gene mutation. Researches of static and dynamic object perception, face perception and oculomotor control are discussed in the article. The results obtained by subjects with FX syndrome are compared with ASD data, syndrome with closed behavioral phenotype. Several factors that underlie visual cognitive deficit are discussed in the article.        
9806479	CGG repeat interruptions in the FMR1 gene in patients with infantile autism.          We determined the CGG repeat length and AGG interruptions in the FMR1 gene in normal Chinese subjects and patients with infantile autism and mild mental retardation. Genomic DNA was investigated by PCR and Southern hybridisation for CGG repeat number and PCR with Mnl I restriction analysis for AGG interruption. Both the normal subjects and the patients with autism have 53 CGG repeats in FMR1, and the majority have two interspersed AGG. Our normal Chinese subjects have a similar number of interspersed AGG as other populations. When compared with the normal subjects, the autism patients have less AGG interruptions and a different pattern of AGG distribution. There was a significant difference in the CGG configurations between normal subjects and patients with autism. The latter had less interspersed AGG, as in fragile X patients, but they did not have fragile X. A study on mentally retarded patients with no infantile autism should also be carried out to ascertain whether mental retardation alone may have contributed to such AGG pattern.        
23042784	Genome-wide DNA hydroxymethylation changes are associated with neurodevelopmental genes in the developing human cerebellum.          5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine that has been suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in neurodevelopment. While DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated during neurodevelopment, little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Here, we report DNA hydroxymethylation dynamics during cerebellum development in the human brain. Overall, we find a positive correlation between 5-hmC levels and cerebellum development. Genome-wide profiling reveals that 5-hmC is highly enriched on specific gene regions including exons and especially the untranslated regions (UTRs), but it is depleted on introns and intergenic regions. Furthermore, we have identified fetus-specific and adult-specific differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs), most of which overlap with genes and CpG island shores. Surprisingly, during development, DhMRs are highly enriched in genes encoding mRNAs that can be regulated by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), some of which are disrupted in autism, as well as in many known autism genes. Our results suggest that 5-hmC-mediated epigenetic regulation may broadly impact the development of the human brain, and its dysregulation could contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Accession number: Sequencing data have been deposited to GEO with accession number GSE40539.        
29480774	The Emergence of Effortful Control in Young Boys With Fragile X Syndrome.         FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, autism, effortful control, temperament Effortful control, or the ability to suppress a dominant response to perform a subdominant response, is an early-emerging temperament trait that is linked with positive social-emotional development. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder characterized by hallmark regulatory impairments, suggesting diminished effortful control. This study compared the development of effortful control in preschool boys with FXS ( n = 97) and typical development ( n = 32). Unlike their typical peers, the boys with FXS did not exhibit growth in effortful control over time, which could not be accounted for by adaptive impairments, FMR1 molecular measures, or autism symptoms. These results contribute to our understanding of the childhood phenotype of FXS that may be linked to the poor social-emotional outcomes seen in this group.        
29486296	Abnormal hippocampal theta and gamma hypersynchrony produces network and spike timing disturbances in the Fmr1-KO mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.         Fragile X syndrome, Gamma oscillations, Hippocampus, Neuronal network activity, Spike-field coherence, Theta oscillations Neuronal networks can synchronize their activity through excitatory and inhibitory connections, which is conducive to synaptic plasticity. This synchronization is reflected in rhythmic fluctuations of the extracellular field. In the hippocampus, theta and gamma band LFP oscillations are a hallmark of the processing of spatial information and memory. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an intellectual disability and the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (Belmonte and Bourgeron, 2006). Here, we investigated how neuronal network synchronization in the mouse hippocampus is compromised by the Fmr1 mutation that causes FXS (Santos et al., 2014), relating recently observed single-cell level impairments (Arbab et al., 2017) to neuronal network aberrations. We implanted tetrodes in hippocampus of freely moving Fmr1-KO and littermate wildtype (WT) mice (Mientjes et al., 2006), to record spike trains from multiple, isolated neurons as well as LFPs in a spatial exploration paradigm. Compared to wild type mice, Fmr1-KO mice displayed greater power of hippocampal theta oscillations, and higher coherence in the slow gamma band. Additionally, spike trains of Fmr1-KO interneurons show decreased spike-count correlations and they are hypersynchronized with theta and slow gamma oscillations. The hypersynchronization of Fmr1-KO oscillations and spike timing reflects functional deficits in local networks. This network hypersynchronization pathologically decreases the heterogeneity of spike-LFP phase coupling, compromising information processing within the hippocampal circuit. These findings may reflect a pathophysiological mechanism explaining cognitive impairments in FXS and autism, in which there is anomalous processing of social and environmental cues and associated deficits in memory and cognition.          
29163043	Combination Therapy in Fragile X Syndrome; Possibilities and Pitfalls Illustrated by Targeting the mGluR5 and GABA Pathway Simultaneously.         FMR1, Fmr1 KO mouse, Fragile X syndrome, GABA, autism, automated tube test, bumetanide, mGluR5 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenetic cause of intellectual disability and autism. The disorder is characterized by altered synaptic plasticity in the brain. Synaptic plasticity is tightly regulated by a complex balance of different synaptic pathways. In FXS, various synaptic pathways are disrupted, including the excitatory metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and the inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways. Targeting each of these pathways individually, has demonstrated beneficial effects in animal models, but not in patients with FXS. This lack of translation might be due to oversimplification of the disease mechanisms when targeting only one affected pathway, in spite of the complexity of the many pathways implicated in FXS. In this report we outline the hypothesis that targeting more than one pathway simultaneously, a combination therapy, might improve treatment effects in FXS. In addition, we present a glance of the first results of chronic combination therapy on social behavior in         Fmr1 KO mice. In contrast to what we expected, targeting both the mGluR5 and the GABAergic pathways simultaneously did not result in a synergistic effect, but in a slight worsening of the social behavior phenotype. This does implicate that both pathways are interconnected and important for social behavior. Our results underline the tremendous fine-tuning that is needed to reach the excitatory-inhibitory balance in the synapse in relation to social behavior. We believe that alternative strategies focused on combination therapy should be further explored, including targeting pathways in different cellular compartments or cell-types.
29163124	The Search for an Effective Therapy to Treat Fragile X Syndrome: Dream or Reality?         ASD, FMR1, Fragile X Syndrome, IGF-1, MMP-9, endocannabinoid system, oxytocin, serotonin Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of intellectual disability and a primary cause of autism. It originates from the lack of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which is an RNA-binding protein encoded by the Fragile X Mental Retardation Gene 1 (        FMR1) gene. Multiple roles have been attributed to this protein, ranging from RNA transport (from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but also along neurites) to translational control of mRNAs. Over the last 20 years many studies have found a large number of FMRP mRNA targets, but it is still not clear which are those playing a critical role in the etiology of FXS. So far, no therapy for FXS has been found, making the quest for novel targets of considerable importance. Several pharmacological approaches have been attempted, but, despite some promising preclinical results, no strategy gave successful outcomes, due either to the induction of major side effects or to the lack of improvement of the phenotypes. However, these studies suggested that, in order to measure the effectiveness of a specific treatment, trials should be redesigned and new endpoints defined in FXS patients. Nevertheless, the search for new therapeutic targets for FXS is very active. In this context, the advances in animal modeling, coupled with better understanding of neurobiology and physiopathology of FXS, are of crucial importance in developing new selected treatments. Here, we discuss the pathways that were recently linked to the physiopathology of FXS (mGluR, GABAR, insulin, Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), MPP-9, serotonin, oxytocin and endocannabinoid signaling) and that suggest new approaches to find an effective therapy for this disorder. Our goal with this review article is to summarize some recent relevant findings on FXS treatment strategies in order to have a clearer view of the different pathways analyzed to date emphasizing those shared with other synaptic disorders.
23660195	"Long-lasting effects of minocycline on behavior in young but not adult Fragile X mice.          Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common single-gene inherited form of intellectual disability with behaviors characteristic of autism. People with FXS display childhood seizures, hyperactivity, anxiety, developmental delay, attention deficits, and visual-spatial memory impairment, as well as a propensity for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Several of these aberrant behaviors and FXS-associated synaptic irregularities also occur in ""fragile X mental retardation gene"" knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice. We previously reported that minocycline promotes the maturation of dendritic spines - postsynaptic sites for excitatory synapses - in the developing hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice, which may underlie the beneficial effects of minocycline on anxiolytic behavior in young Fmr1 KO mice. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of minocycline treatment in young and adult Fmr1 KO mice, and determined the dependence of behavioral improvements on short-term versus long-term minocycline administration. We found that 4- and 8-week-long treatments significantly reduced locomotor activity in both young and adult Fmr1 KO mice. Some behavioral improvements persisted in young mice post-treatment, but in adults the beneficial effects were lost soon after minocycline treatment was stopped. We also show, for the first time, that minocycline treatment partially attenuates the number and severity of audiogenic seizures in Fmr1 KO mice. This report provides further evidence that minocycline treatment has immediate and long-lasting benefits on FXS-associated behaviors in the Fmr1 KO mouse model.          "
23660422	Fragile X screening by quantification of FMRP in dried blood spots by a Luminex immunoassay.          Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and is frequently associated with autism. The syndrome is due to mutations of the FMR1 gene that result in the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We have developed a rapid, highly sensitive method for quantifying FMRP from dried blood spots and lymphocytes. This assay uses two new antibodies, a bacterially expressed abbreviated FMRP standard, and a Luminex platform to quantify FMRP. The assay readily distinguished between samples from males with fragile X full mutations and samples from normal males. It also differentiated mosaic from nonmosaic full-mutation male samples. This assay, because of its methodology and minimal cost, could be the basis for newborn or population screening.           
27597551	Fragile X syndrome: Are signaling lipids the missing culprits?         Diacylglycerol, Diacylglycerol kinase, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, Lipid signaling, Phosphatidic acid Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism. FXS results from the absence of FMRP, an RNA binding protein associated to ribosomes that influences the translation of specific mRNAs in post-synaptic compartments of neurons. The main molecular consequence of the absence of FMRP is an excessive translation of neuronal protein in several areas of the brain. This local protein synthesis deregulation is proposed to underlie the defect in synaptic plasticity responsible for FXS. Recent findings in neurons of the fragile X mouse model (Fmr1-KO) uncovered another consequence of the lack of FMRP: a deregulation of the diacylglycerol (DAG)/phosphatidic acid (PA) homeostasis. DAG and PA are two interconvertible lipids that influence membrane architecture and that act as essential signaling molecules that activate various downstream effectors, including master regulators of local protein synthesis and actin polymerization. As a consequence, DAG and PA govern a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, vesicle/membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organization. At the synapse, the level of these lipids is proposed to influence the synaptic activation status. FMRP appears as a master regulator of this neuronal process by controlling the translation of a diacylglycerol kinase enzyme that converts DAG into PA. The deregulated levels of DAG and PA caused by the absence of FMRP could represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of FXS.          
15817054	Theory of mind deficits in children with fragile X syndrome.          Given the consistent findings of theory of mind deficits in children with autism, it would be extremely beneficial to examine the profile of theory of mind abilities in other clinical groups such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS). Aim The aim of the present study was to assess whether boys with FXS are impaired in simple social situations that require them to understand their own and others' mental states - in essence: do they have a 'theory of mind'?          
23934111	De novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies.          Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.         
21364941	Genetic-background modulation of core and variable autistic-like symptoms in Fmr1 knock-out mice.          No animal models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with good construct validity are currently available; using genetic models of pathologies characterized by ASD-like deficits, but with known causes, may be therefore a promising strategy. The Fmr1-KO mouse is an example of this approach, modeling Fragile X syndrome, a well-known genetic disorder presenting ASD symptoms. The Fmr1-KO is available on different genetic backgrounds (FVB versus C57BL/6), which may explain some of the conflicting results that have been obtained with these mutants up till now.          
22693142	Defining genetically meaningful language and personality traits in relatives of individuals with fragile X syndrome and relatives of individuals with autism.          Substantial phenotypic overlap exists between fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism, suggesting that FMR1 (the gene causing FXS) poses a significant risk for autism. Cross-population comparisons of FXS and autism therefore offer a potentially valuable method for refining the range of phenotypes associated with variation in FMR1. This study adopted a broader phenotype approach, focusing on parents who are at increased genetic liability for autism or FXS. Women who were carriers of FMR1 in its premutation state were compared with mothers of individuals with autism, and controls in an attempt to determine whether subtle features of the broad autism phenotype may express at elevated rates among FMR1 premutation carriers. The principal personality and language features comprising the broad autism phenotype (i.e., rigid and aloof personality, and particular patterns of pragmatic language use) were assessed among 49 premutation carriers who were mothers of individuals with FXS, 89 mothers of individuals with autism, and 23 mothers of typically developing individuals. Relative to controls, the autism and premutation parent groups showed elevated rates of certain personality and language characteristics of the broad autism phenotype. Findings suggest partially overlapping personality and language profiles among autism and premutation parent groups, with rigid personality style and patterns of pragmatic language use emerging as features most clearly shared between groups. These results provide further evidence for the overlap of autism and FXS, and may implicate FMR1 in some of the subtle features comprising the broad autism phenotype.          
17965627	"Epigenetics and Neural developmental disorders: Washington DC, September 18 and 19, 2006.          Neural developmental disorders, such as autism, Rett Syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and Angelman syndrome manifest during early postnatal neural development. Although the genes responsible for some of these disorders have been identified, how the mutations of these genes affect neural development is currently unclear. Emerging evidence suggest that these disorders share common underlying defects in neuronal morphology, synaptic connectivity and brain plasticity. In particular, alterations in dendritic branching and spine morphology play a central role in the pathophysiology of most mental retardation disorders, suggesting that common pathways regulating neuronal function may be affected. Epigenetic modulations, mediated by DNA methylation, RNA-associated silencing, and histone modification, can serve as an intermediate process that imprints dynamic environmental experiences on the ""fixed"" genome, resulting in stable alterations in phenotypes. Disturbance in epigenetic regulations can lead to inappropriate expression or silencing of genes, causing an array of multi-system disorders and neoplasias. Rett syndrome, the most common form of mental retardation in young girls, is due to l mutation of MECP2, encoding a methylated DNA binding protein that translates DNA methylation into gene repression. Angelman syndrome is due to faulty genomic imprinting or maternal mutations in UBE3A. Fragile X Syndrome, in most cases, results from the hypermethylation of FMR1 promoter, hence the loss of expression of functional FMRP protein. Autism, with its complex etiology, may have strong epigenetic link. Together, these observations strongly suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play a critical role in brain development and etiology of related disorders. This report summarizes the scientific discussions and major conclusions from a recent conference that aimed to gain insight into the common molecular pathways affected among these disorders and discover potential therapeutic targets that have been missed by looking at one disorder at a time.

28050218	A developmental, longitudinal investigation of autism phenotypic profiles in fragile X syndrome.         Autism spectrum disorder, Endophenotype, FMR1 gene, Fragile X syndrome, Language, Longitudinal, Pragmatics, Social behavior Targeting overlapping behavioral phenotypes in neurogenetic disorders can help elucidate gene-behavior relationships. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been studied as a model for this approach, and important areas of phenotypic overlap and divergence have been documented. However, few studies have examined how the manifestation of ASD-related phenotypes in FXS may change over development, a question which has important implications for conceptualizing shared etiologies of these disorders and their constituent phenotypes. The goal of this study was to characterize ASD phenotypes in boys and girls with FXS across development, as well as to compare individual component phenotypes among boys with FXS and boys with idiopathic ASD (ASD-O) over time.          
22993295	Reversal of disease-related pathologies in the fragile X mouse model by selective activation of GABAB receptors with arbaclofen.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism, results from the transcriptional silencing of FMR1 and loss of the mRNA translational repressor protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Patients with FXS exhibit changes in neuronal dendritic spine morphology, a pathology associated with altered synaptic function. Studies in the mouse model of fragile X have shown that loss of FMRP causes excessive synaptic protein synthesis, which results in synaptic dysfunction and altered spine morphology. We tested whether the pharmacologic activation of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor could correct or reverse these phenotypes in Fmr1-knockout mice. Basal protein synthesis, which is elevated in the hippocampus of Fmr1-knockout mice, was corrected by the in vitro application of the selective GABA(B) receptor agonist STX209 (arbaclofen, R-baclofen). STX209 also reduced to wild-type values the elevated AMPA receptor internalization in Fmr1-knockout cultured neurons, a known functional consequence of increased protein synthesis. Acute administration of STX209 in vivo, at doses that modify behavior, decreased mRNA translation in the cortex of Fmr1-knockout mice. Finally, the chronic administration of STX209 in juvenile mice corrected the increased spine density in Fmr1-knockout mice without affecting spine density in wild-type mice. Thus, activation of the GABA(B) receptor with STX209 corrected synaptic abnormalities considered central to fragile X pathophysiology, a finding that suggests that STX209 may be a potentially effective therapy to treat the core symptoms of FXS.        
23011134	Uncoupling of the endocannabinoid signalling complex in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X syndrome, the most commonly known genetic cause of autism, is due to loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein, which regulates signal transduction at metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 in the brain. Fragile X mental retardation protein deletion in mice enhances metabotropic glutamate receptor-5-dependent long-term depression in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Here we show that a distinct type of metabotropic glutamate receptor-5-dependent long-term depression at excitatory synapses of the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex, which is mediated by the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol, is absent in fragile X mental retardation protein-null mice. In these mutants, the macromolecular complex that links metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 to the 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol-producing enzyme, diacylglycerol lipase-α (endocannabinoid signalosome), is disrupted and metabotropic glutamate receptor-5-dependent 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol formation is compromised. These changes are accompanied by impaired endocannabinoid-dependent long-term depression. Pharmacological enhancement of 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol signalling normalizes this synaptic defect and corrects behavioural abnormalities in fragile X mental retardation protein-deficient mice. The results identify the endocannabinoid signalosome as a molecular substrate for fragile X syndrome, which might be targeted by therapy.        
20300527	GSK3 influences social preference and anxiety-related behaviors during social interaction in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome and autism.          Nearly 1% of children in the United States exhibit autism spectrum disorders, but causes and treatments remain to be identified. Mice with deletion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene are used to model autism because loss of Fmr1 gene function causes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and many people with FXS exhibit autistic-like behaviors. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is hyperactive in brains of Fmr1 knockout mice, and inhibition of GSK3 by lithium administration ameliorates some behavioral impairment in these mice. We extended our studies of this association by testing whether GSK3 contributes to socialization behaviors. This used two mouse models with disrupted regulation of GSK3, Fmr1 knockout mice and GSK3 knockin mice, in which inhibitory serines of the two isoforms of GSK3, GSK3alpha and GSK3beta, are mutated to alanines, leaving GSK3 fully active.          
21107340	Four sisters compound heterozygotes for the pre- and full mutation in fragile X syndrome and a complete inactivation of X-functional chromosome: implications for genetic counseling.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder and a leading monogenic form of cognitive impairment and autism. It is the most common form of inherited mental retardation in males and a significant cause of mental retardation in females. It is caused by the instability and subsequent expansion of the CGG repeat in the promoter region of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene at Xq27.3. We describe a double consanguineous family with four sisters compound heterozygotes for the full and pre-mutation CGG repeat size. The index case shows clinical features of the affected males with profound mental retardation; the other three sisters also suffer from mental retardation, ranging from mild to severe. Molecular analysis reveals very similar ranges for the CGG expansions for both chromosomes in all four sisters. The phenotypic differences observed in the index case and her sisters are the total inactivation of X premutated chromosome and the total absence of FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein). This family case raises important issues for genetic counseling in families with consanguinity and with cases of idiopathic mental retardation.        
21108954	The role of fragile X mental retardation protein in major mental disorders.          Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is highly enriched in neurons and binds to approximately 4% of mRNAs in mammalian brain. Its loss is a hallmark of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of mental retardation. In this review we discuss the mutation in the fragile X mental retardation-1 gene (FMR1), that leads to FXS, the role FMRP plays in neuronal cells, experiments from our own laboratory that demonstrate reductions of FMRP in additional psychiatric disorders (autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder), and potential therapies to ameliorate the loss of FMRP. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Trends in neuropharmacology: in memory of Erminio Costa'.          
25224527	Identification of fragile X syndrome specific molecular markers in human fibroblasts: a useful model to test the efficacy of therapeutic drugs.         FMR1, FMRP, Fragile X syndrome, S6K1, fibroblasts, protein synthesis Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism. It is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of translation of a subset of brain mRNAs. In Fmr1 knockout mice, the absence of FMRP results in elevated protein synthesis in the brain as well as increased signaling of many translational regulators. Whether protein synthesis is also dysregulated in FXS patients is not firmly established. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblasts from FXS patients have significantly elevated rates of basal protein synthesis along with increased levels of phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphorylated p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (p-S6K1). The treatment with small molecules that inhibit S6K1 and a known FMRP target, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit p110β, lowered the rates of protein synthesis in both control and patient fibroblasts. Our data thus demonstrate that fibroblasts from FXS patients may be a useful in vitro model to test the efficacy and toxicity of potential therapeutics prior to clinical trials, as well as for drug screening and designing personalized treatment approaches.           
25227249	Learning and behavioral deficits associated with the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein: what a fly and mouse model can teach us.          The Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited mental disability and is considered a monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by a triplet expansion that inhibits the expression of the FMR1 gene. The gene product, the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), regulates mRNA metabolism in brain and nonneuronal cells. During brain development, FMRP controls the expression of key molecules involved in receptor signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, protein synthesis and, ultimately, spine morphology. Symptoms associated with FXS include neurodevelopmental delay, cognitive impairment, anxiety, hyperactivity, and autistic-like behavior. Twenty years ago the first Fmr1 KO mouse to study FXS was generated, and several years later other key models including the mutant Drosophila melanogaster, dFmr1, have further helped the understanding of the cellular and molecular causes behind this complex syndrome. Here, we review to which extent these biological models are affected by the absence of FMRP, pointing out the similarities with the observed human dysfunction. Additionally, we discuss several potential treatments under study in animal models that are able to partially revert some of the FXS abnormalities.           
28451631	GABA-B Agonist Baclofen Normalizes Auditory-Evoked Neural Oscillations and Behavioral Deficits in the         Fmr1 Knockout Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome. EEG, GABA, fragile X syndrome, gamma, racemic baclofen, working memory Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from         FMR1 gene mutation that leads to intellectual disability, autism-like symptoms, and sensory hypersensitivity. Arbaclofen, a GABA-B agonist, has shown efficacy in some individuals with FXS but has become unavailable after unsuccessful clinical trials, prompting interest in publicly available, racemic baclofen. The present study investigated whether racemic baclofen can remediate abnormalities of neural circuit function, sensory processing, and behavior in Fmr1 knockout mice, a rodent model of fragile X syndrome. Fmr1 knockout mice showed increased baseline and auditory-evoked high-frequency gamma (30-80 Hz) power relative to C57BL/6 controls, as measured by electroencephalography. These deficits were accompanied by decreased T maze spontaneous alternation, decreased social interactions, and increased open field center time, suggestive of diminished working memory, sociability, and anxiety-like behavior, respectively. Abnormal auditory-evoked gamma oscillations, working memory, and anxiety-related behavior were normalized by treatment with baclofen, but impaired sociability was not. Improvements in working memory were evident predominantly in mice whose auditory-evoked gamma oscillations were dampened by baclofen. These findings suggest that racemic baclofen may be useful for targeting sensory and cognitive disturbances in fragile X syndrome.
28915148	Adult Fmr1 knockout mice present with deficiencies in hippocampal interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α expression.          Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a single genetic mutation in the FMR1 gene. Mutations in the FMR1 gene are the largest monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and thus both disorders share many of the same cognitive and behavioral impairments. There is increasing evidence suggesting that dysregulated immune responses play a role in the pathophysiology of ASD; however, the association between FXS and altered immunity requires further investigation. This study examined whether Fmr1 knockout (KO) and wild-type mice on a FVB/NJ background strain had altered cytokine expression at baseline levels in the hippocampus. Results showed Fmr1 KO mice to have decreased proinflammatory cytokine hippocampal mRNA expression, specifically interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, compared with wild-type mice. However, no differences were detected in the expression levels of IL-1β, MCP-1, interferon-γ, or IL-10. Despite the high comorbidity between FXS and ASD, these results suggest that the Fmr1 KO mouse does not mimic the increased proinflammatory cytokine expression commonly found in ASD mouse models and patients. Further investigation of the immune profile of the Fmr1 KO mouse is critical to understand whether this deficiency of cytokines in the hippocampus is indicative of a broader immunologic deficit associated with FXS.        
18957214	Fragile X syndrome: loss of local mRNA regulation alters synaptic development and function.          Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of cognitive deficiency in humans and perhaps the best-understood single cause of autism. A trinucleotide repeat expansion, inactivating the X-linked FMR1 gene, leads to the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein. FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein that regulates the local translation of a subset of mRNAs at synapses in response to activation of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and possibly other receptors. In the absence of FMRP, excess and dysregulated mRNA translation leads to altered synaptic function and loss of protein synthesis-dependent plasticity. Recent evidence indicates the role of FMRP in regulated mRNA transport in dendrites. New studies also suggest a possible local function of FMRP in axons that may be important for guidance, synaptic development, and formation of neural circuits. The understanding of FMRP function at synapses has led to rationale therapeutic approaches.        
21475730	Clinical assessment of DSM-IV anxiety disorders in fragile X syndrome: prevalence and characterization.         Anxiety, Fragile X syndrome, Intellectual disability, Social phobia, Specific phobia Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID). Anxiety and social withdrawal are considered core features of the FXS phenotype, yet there is limited diagnostic evidence of the prevalence of formal anxiety disorders in FXS. This study assessed the prevalence of anxiety disorders in a sample of 58 males and 39 females with FXS (ages 5.0-33.3 years). Participants' parents completed the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS-IV), a clinical interview based on DSM-IV criteria, and the Anxiety Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS), a psychiatric disorders screening instrument normed in ID. We conducted cognitive (IQ) and autism (AUT) assessments and surveyed medication use. Despite a high rate of psychopharmacological treatment, 86.2% of males and 76.9% of females met criteria for an anxiety disorder, with social phobia and specific phobia the most commonly diagnosed. Proband status, gender, and IQ were not significantly related to any anxiety disorders, however significantly higher rates of a few anxiety disorders were found in older age and AUT groups. Significant correlations between ADIS diagnoses and ADAMS scores provided cross-validation of instruments, indicating that the ADIS is suitable for use in FXS. A greater percentage of our sample met criteria for most anxiety disorders than has been reported in other ID groups or the general population. The rate of anxiety compared to general ID suggests that the FMR1 full mutation confers an especially high risk for these disorders, regardless of factors commonly associated with FXS clinical involvement. A thorough clinical assessment and treatment of anxiety should be included in the FXS standard of care.        
21478165	Differential usage of transcriptional start sites and polyadenylation sites in FMR1 premutation alleles.          5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) are important regulators of gene expression and play key roles in disease progression and susceptibility. The 5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene contains a CGG repeat element that is expanded (>200 CGG repeats; full mutation) and methylated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and known cause of autism. Significant phenotypic involvement has also emerged in some individuals with the premutation (55-200 CGG repeats), including fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) in females, and the neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in older adult carriers. Here, we show that FMR1 mRNA in human and mouse brain is expressed as a combination of multiple isoforms that use alternative transcriptional start sites and different polyadenylation sites. Furthermore, we have identified a novel human transcription start site used in brain but not in lymphoblastoid cells, and have detected FMR1 isoforms generated through the use of both canonical and non-canonical polyadenylation signals. Importantly, in both human and mouse, a specific regulation of the UTRs is observed in brain of FMR1 premutation alleles, suggesting that the transcript variants may play a role in premutation-related pathologies.

FXS serves as an excellent model disorder for studies investigating disturbed molecular mechanisms and synapse function underlying cognitive impairment, autism, and behavioral disturbance. Abnormalities in dendritic spines and synaptic transmission in the brain of FXS individuals and mouse models for FXS indicate perturbations in the development, maintenance, and plasticity of neuronal network connectivity. However, numerous alterations are found during the early development in FXS, including abnormal differentiation of neural progenitors and impaired migration of newly born neurons. Several aspects of FMRP function are modulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. Here, we review the evidence of the role for BDNF in the developing and adult FXS brain. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'BDNF Regulation of Synaptic Structure, Function, and Plasticity'.          
23740941	Delayed myelination in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.          Fragile X Syndrome is the most common inherited cause of autism. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent in fragile X, is an mRNA binding protein that regulates the translation of hundreds of different mRNA transcripts. In the adult brain, FMRP is expressed primarily in the neurons; however, it is also expressed in developing glial cells, where its function is not well understood. Here, we show that fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mice display abnormalities in the myelination of cerebellar axons as early as the first postnatal week, corresponding roughly to the equivalent time in human brain development when symptoms of the syndrome first become apparent (1-3 years of age). At postnatal day (PND) 7, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging showed reduced volume of the Fmr1 cerebellum compared with wild-type mice, concomitant with an 80-85% reduction in the expression of myelin basic protein, fewer myelinated axons and reduced thickness of myelin sheaths, as measured by electron microscopy. Both the expression of the proteoglycan NG2 and the number of PDGFRα+/NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells were reduced in the Fmr1 cerebellum at PND 7. Although myelin proteins were still depressed at PND 15, they regained wild-type levels by PND 30. These findings suggest that impaired maturation or function of oligodendrocyte precursor cells induces delayed myelination in the Fmr1 mouse brain. Our results bolster an emerging recognition that white matter abnormalities in early postnatal brain development represent an underlying neurological deficit in Fragile X syndrome.         
23747611	Effects of stimulus salience on touchscreen serial reversal learning in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.         Behavioral flexibility, Executive function, Fmr1, Fragile X syndrome Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability in males and the most common genetic cause of autism. Although executive dysfunction is consistently found in humans with FXS, evidence of executive dysfunction in Fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model of FXS, has been inconsistent. One possible explanation for this is that executive dysfunction in Fmr1 KO mice, similar to humans with FXS, is only evident when cognitive demands are high. Using touchscreen operant conditioning chambers, male Fmr1 KO mice and their male wildtype littermates were tested on the acquisition of a pairwise visual discrimination followed by four serial reversals of the response rule. We assessed reversal learning performance under two different conditions. In the first, the correct stimulus was salient and the incorrect stimulus was non-salient. In the second and more challenging condition, the incorrect stimulus was salient and the correct stimulus was non-salient; this increased cognitive load by introducing conflict between sensory-driven (i.e., bottom-up) and task-dependent (i.e., top-down) signals. Fmr1 KOs displayed two distinct impairments relative to wildtype littermates. First, Fmr1 KOs committed significantly more learning-type errors during the second reversal stage, but only under high cognitive load. Second, during the first reversal stage, Fmr1 KOs committed significantly more attempts to collect a reward during the timeout following an incorrect response. These findings indicate that Fmr1 KO mice display executive dysfunction that, in some cases, is only evident under high cognitive load.           
26670047	Elevated CaMKIIα and Hyperphosphorylation of Homer Mediate Circuit Dysfunction in a Fragile X Syndrome Mouse Model.          Abnormal metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) function, as a result of disrupted scaffolding with its binding partner Homer, contributes to the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, a common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism caused by mutations in Fmr1. How loss of Fmr1 disrupts mGluR5-Homer scaffolds is unknown, and little is known about the dynamic regulation of mGluR5-Homer scaffolds in wild-type neurons. Here, we demonstrate that brief (minutes-long) elevations in neural activity cause CaMKIIα-mediated phosphorylation of long Homer proteins and dissociation from mGluR5 at synapses. In Fmr1 knockout (KO) cortex, Homers are hyperphosphorylated as a result of elevated CaMKIIα protein. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CaMKIIα or replacement of Homers with dephosphomimetics restores mGluR5-Homer scaffolds and multiple Fmr1 KO phenotypes, including circuit hyperexcitability and/or seizures. This work links translational control of an FMRP target mRNA, CaMKIIα, to the molecular-, cellular-, and circuit-level brain dysfunction in a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.           
17097142	Molecular and cognitive predictors of the continuum of autistic behaviours in fragile X.          The distributions of scores for autistic behaviours obtained from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale-Generic (ADOS-G) were investigated in 147 males and females affected with the full mutation in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, in 59 individuals with the premutation, and in 42 non-fragile X relatives, aged 4-70 years. The scores representing communication and social interaction were continuously distributed across the two fragile X groups, and they were significantly elevated compared with the non-fragile X controls. Strong relationships were found between both these scores and FMRP deficits, but they became insignificant for social interaction, and the sum of social interaction and communication scores, when FSIQ was included as another predictor of autism scores. Other significant predictors of these scores in both sexes were those executive skills which related to verbal fluency, and to the regulation and control of motor behaviour. Overall, our data have shown that cognitive impairment, especially of verbal skills, best explains the comorbidity of autism and fragile X. This implies some more fundamental perturbations of specific neural connections which are essential for both specific behaviours and cognition. We also emphasize that FXS offers a unique molecular model for autism since FMRP regulates the translation of many other genes involved in synaptic formation and plasticity which should be natural targets for further exploration.        
28366741	Reduced Lateral Inhibition Impairs Olfactory Computations and Behaviors in a Drosophila Model of Fragile X Syndrome.         Drosophila melanogaster, antennal lobe, autism, calcium imaging, fragile X syndrome, fruit fly, lateral inhibition, mental disabilities, neural circuits, olfaction Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients present neuronal alterations that lead to severe intellectual disability, but the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. An emerging hypothesis postulates that reduced GABAergic inhibition of excitatory neurons is a key component in the pathophysiology of FXS. Here, we directly test this idea in a FXS Drosophila model. We show that FXS flies exhibit strongly impaired olfactory behaviors. In line with this, olfactory representations are less odor specific due to broader response tuning of excitatory projection neurons. We find that impaired inhibitory interactions underlie reduced specificity in olfactory computations. Finally, we show that defective lateral inhibition across projection neurons is caused by weaker inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. We provide direct evidence that deficient inhibition impairs sensory computations and behavior in an in vivo model of FXS. Together with evidence of impaired inhibition in autism and Rett syndrome, these findings suggest a potentially general mechanism for intellectual disability.          
18579676	Temporal requirements of the fragile X mental retardation protein in the regulation of synaptic structure.          Fragile X syndrome (FraX), caused by the loss-of-function of one gene (FMR1), is the most common inherited form of both mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders. The FMR1 product (FMRP) is an mRNA-binding translation regulator that mediates activity-dependent control of synaptic structure and function. To develop any FraX intervention strategy, it is essential to define when and where FMRP loss causes the manifestation of synaptic defects, and whether the reintroduction of FMRP can restore normal synapse properties. In the Drosophila FraX model, dFMRP loss causes neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse over-elaboration (overgrowth, overbranching, excess synaptic boutons), accumulation of development-arrested satellite boutons, and altered neurotransmission. We used the Gene-Switch method to conditionally drive dFMRP expression to define the spatiotemporal requirements in synaptic mechanisms. Constitutive induction of targeted neuronal dFMRP at wild-type levels rescues all synaptic architectural defects in Drosophila Fmr1 (dfmr1)-null mutants, demonstrating a presynaptic requirement for synapse structuring. By contrast, presynaptic dFMRP expression does not ameliorate functional neurotransmission defects, indicating a postsynaptic dFMRP requirement. Strikingly, targeted early induction of dFMRP effects nearly complete rescue of synaptic structure defects, showing a primarily early-development role. In addition, acute dFMRP expression at maturity partially alleviates dfmr1-null defects, although rescue is not as complete as either early or constitutive dFMRP expression, showing a modest capacity for late-stage structural plasticity. We conclude that dFMRP predominantly acts early in synaptogenesis to modulate architecture, but that late dFMRP introduction at maturity can weakly compensate for early absence of dFMRP function.        
26239490	Dysregulation of FMRP/mTOR Signaling Cascade in Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury of Premature Human Brain.         autism, brain injury, fragile X mental retardation protein, hypoxia, mammalian target of rapamycin, prematurity In this study the authors investigated whether dysregulation of the fragile X mental retardation protein and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling cascade can have a role in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy of prematurity following perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. The authors examined the brain tissue of newborns with encephalopathy and compared it to age-matched controls with normal brain development and adults. In normal controls, the fragile X mental retardation protein expression in cortical gray matter spiked 4-fold during 36-39 gestational weeks compared to the adult, with a concomitant suppression of p70S6K and S6. In encephalopathy cases, the developmental spike of fragile X mental retardation protein was not observed, and fragile X mental retardation protein levels remained significantly lower than in normal controls. Importantly, this fragile X mental retardation protein downregulation was followed by a significant overexpression of p70S6K and S6. These novel findings thus suggest that premature hypoxic-ischemic brain injury can affect the fragile X mental retardation protein/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, as otherwise observed in inherited syndromes of cognitive disability and autism spectrum disorders.
